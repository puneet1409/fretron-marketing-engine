**Subject:** Finding 8–15% freight savings in your top 10 lanes

Hi [Name],

We work with manufacturing companies with large outbound road networks—particularly in steel, CPG, and chemicals sectors.

Across similar networks, we've seen **5–15% reduction in freight costs** and **3–5 point OTIF improvement** by pulling a handful of specific levers:

- LTL→FTL consolidation
- Smarter route selection
- Cleaner detention & sourcing discipline

**Here's what's different:**

Instead of jumping into another TMS demo, we start with a **Move-as-One Value Lever Audit**—a 30-minute working session where we map your operation on our value map and identify which 3–5 levers would realistically move your numbers.

**What you get:**
- One-page snapshot of your logistics maturity across Cost, Service, Risk, and Digital pillars
- 3–5 prioritized levers with expected impact ranges (based on industry benchmarks)
- Optional: data-backed simulation on your actual network (if you want to go deeper)

Would you be open to a short session next week? No data extract needed—we use your answers and our benchmarks to give you the snapshot.

Best regards,

## Template 2: LinkedIn Message

Hi [Name],

Noticed you're leading logistics at [Company]. We've been helping steel/CPG companies reduce freight cost by 8–12% and improve OTIF—not with a generic TMS, but by identifying a small set of **value levers** that actually fit their network.

We run a free 30-min **Move-as-One Value Lever Audit**—you + your team, no data extract. Just a guided diagnostic that shows where your strongest levers are.

Interested in a quick chat?

## Template 3: Cold Call Talk Track

**Hook (15 seconds):**

"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from Fretron. We've been helping companies like [Reference Company] in steel/CPG reduce freight cost by around 8–12% and improve OTIF by a few points—not with a generic TMS, but by identifying a small set of **value levers** that actually fit their network."

**Pause for response**

**Value Offer (20 seconds):**

"What we're offering is different—it's a free 30-minute **Move-as-One Value Lever Audit**. You, your logistics lead, maybe someone from finance. No data extract needed; just a guided diagnostic where we map your operation and show you which 3–5 levers would realistically move your numbers."

**Qualifying Question:**

"Are you currently looking at ways to reduce freight cost or improve on-time performance?"

**If Yes:**

"Great! When would be a good time for that 30-minute session? We can do it next week, and you'll walk away with a one-page snapshot of where your leverage points are."

**If No/Not Sure:**

"No problem. Can I send you a quick email with some details? Even if it's not urgent now, it's useful to know where those levers are when budget season comes around."

## Template 4: Follow-up Email (After No Response)

**Subject:** Quick follow-up: Your logistics leverage points

Hi [Name],

Following up on my email from [Date] about the Value Lever Audit.

I realize your inbox is probably overflowing, so here's the TL;DR:

✅ **30-minute audit** (no data needed)
✅ **One-page output**: your maturity + 3–5 priority levers
✅ **Industry benchmarks**: 5–15% cost reduction, 3–5 point OTIF gain
✅ **Optional simulation** on your actual lanes if you want to go deeper

Most teams find it valuable even if they're not actively shopping for a TMS right now.

Let me know if next week works!

Best,
[Your Name]

## Response Handling Guide

### If Prospect Says: "We already have a TMS"

**Response:**
"That's great! This isn't about replacing what you have—it's about identifying which specific levers you're not yet pulling. Even with a TMS, most companies are only using 30–40% of the value levers available to them. The audit helps you see what's still on the table."

### If Prospect Says: "Send me some information"

**Response:**
"Absolutely. I'll send you a short deck that explains the value map and shows some examples. But honestly, the real value is in the 30-minute working session—it's tailored to your network, not generic. Would [Day/Time] work for that?"

### If Prospect Says: "How much does it cost?"

**Response:**
"The Value Lever Audit is complimentary—there's no cost. It's how we start conversations, and you get actionable insights regardless of whether you ever become a customer. If you want to do a data-backed simulation after, we can discuss scope then."

### If Prospect Says: "I don't have time right now"

**Response:**
"Totally understand. When would be a better time? I can also send you the one-pager now, and we can schedule something for [next month/next quarter] when things settle down."
