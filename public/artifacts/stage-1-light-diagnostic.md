## Questions

### Pillar 1: Cost & Productivity (6 points total)

#### Q1: Spot Freight Sourcing
**How do you currently source spot freight?**

- [ ] Phone calls to known transporters, no price comparison (0 pts)
- [ ] Email/WhatsApp bidding with 3–5 vendors (1 pt)
- [ ] Digital bidding platform with multi-vendor participation (2 pts)

**Why this matters:** Digital spot sourcing delivers 3–7% cost reduction through price transparency.

---

#### Q2: LTL Shipments
**What % of your shipments are LTL (less than truckload)?**

- [ ] >40% (0 pts)
- [ ] 25–40% (1 pt)
- [ ] <25% (2 pts)

**Why this matters:** High LTL% means 8–15% savings opportunity through load consolidation (LU10).

---

#### Q3: Lane-level Cost Visibility
**Do you track cost per MT-km (PKMMT) at the lane level?**

- [ ] No, only total freight spend (0 pts)
- [ ] Yes, but manually via Excel (1 pt)
- [ ] Yes, real-time dashboards by lane/vendor/plant (2 pts)

**Why this matters:** Lane-level PKMMT tracking enables targeted optimization (5–10% savings on worst lanes).

---

### Pillar 2: Service & Experience (6 points total)

#### Q4: OTIF Performance
**What's your current On-Time-In-Full (OTIF) delivery %?**

- [ ] <75% (0 pts)
- [ ] 75–88% (1 pt)
- [ ] >88% (2 pts)

**Why this matters:** Below 75% = systemic issues; 75–88% = lever activation can add 5–12 points; >88% = fine-tuning only.

---

#### Q5: Exception Management
**How do you handle delivery exceptions (delays, route deviations)?**

- [ ] Customer complaints drive our awareness (0 pts)
- [ ] Control tower team tracks manually, reacts when issues escalate (1 pt)
- [ ] Automated alerts + playbook-driven workflows (2 pts)

**Why this matters:** Proactive exception management improves OTIF by 5–10 points (CT47, CT49).

---

#### Q6: Customer Visibility
**Do your customers have self-service tracking of their shipments?**

- [ ] No, they call us for updates (0 pts)
- [ ] Email/SMS notifications only (1 pt)
- [ ] Self-service portal with live tracking + ETA (2 pts)

**Why this matters:** Customer portals reduce complaint calls by 30–50% (CT45).

---

### Pillar 3: Efficiency & Throughput (4 points total)

#### Q7: Weight/Volume Utilization
**What's your average truck utilization (weight or volume)?**

- [ ] <65% (0 pts)
- [ ] 65–80% (1 pt)
- [ ] >80% (2 pts)

**Why this matters:** <65% utilization = 10–20% savings opportunity via load optimization (LU10, LU12).

---

#### Q8: Detention & TAT
**Average detention time per trip (at plant + consignee)?**

- [ ] >6 hours (0 pts)
- [ ] 3–6 hours (1 pt)
- [ ] <3 hours (2 pts)

**Why this matters:** >6 hrs detention = 30–50% reduction possible via gate scheduling (YG52, YG53).

---

### Pillar 4: Risk & Compliance (4 points total)

#### Q9: E-Way Bill Compliance
**What % of your trips have valid E-Way Bills (for India operations)?**

- [ ] <90% (0 pts)
- [ ] 90–95% (1 pt)
- [ ] >95% (2 pts)

**Why this matters:** <90% = high regulatory risk; automation (DB60) can get you to 99%+.

---

#### Q10: POD Capture
**What % of deliveries have Proof of Delivery (POD) captured?**

- [ ] <85% (0 pts)
- [ ] 85–93% (1 pt)
- [ ] >93% (2 pts)

**Why this matters:** Low POD capture delays invoicing and creates claims disputes; ePOD (DB62) gets you to 95%+.

---

### Next Step Recommendation:

"Your diagnostic shows **Level 1 maturity in Cost & Efficiency**, with immediate savings potential of **8–15% on freight cost** through 3 levers:

1. **LU10** (Consolidation) on your top 10 lanes
2. **TB01** (Digital Bidding) for your spot volume
3. **YG52** (Gate Scheduling) at Jamshedpur & Rourkela plants

**Would you like to see this modeled on your actual shipment data?**

We can run a 2-week simulation using 3–6 months of your shipment data and show you lane-by-lane impact:
- Baseline: Your current PKMMT, LTL%, detention by lane
- Simulated: Post-lever PKMMT, projected savings, ROI timeline"
