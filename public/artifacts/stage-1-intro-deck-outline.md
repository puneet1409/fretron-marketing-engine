# Stage 1: Intro Meeting Deck Outline

## Deck Title: Move-as-One Command Center - Dispatch Edition

**Target Audience:** Head of Supply Chain / Logistics, CFO, Plant Heads, Procurement
**Duration:** 30–40 minutes
**Format:** 10–12 slides

---

## Slide 1: Title Slide

**Title:** Move-as-One Command Center
**Subtitle:** Dispatch Edition for Manufacturing Shippers
**Presenter:** [Your Name], Fretron Technologies

Visual: Fretron logo + Command Center dashboard screenshot

## Slide 2: The Dispatch Challenge (Problem Framing)

**Headline:** Why freight cost & OTIF remain stubborn problems

**Content:**
- Typical Indian manufacturing network:
  - 3–5 plants, 20–50 major lanes
  - ₹50–500 Cr annual freight spend
  - Mix of contract, dedicated, and spot capacity
  - 75–85% OTIF (vs 90%+ target)
  - PKMMT: ₹3.50–4.50 (vs best-in-class ₹3.00–3.20)

**The Gap:**
Most companies know they're overspending and underperforming, but don't know **which specific levers** to pull.

## Slide 3: Why Most TMS Projects Underdeliver

**Headline:** Feature-first vs Value-lever-first

**Two-column comparison:**

| Traditional TMS Approach | Move-as-One Approach |
|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Feature list (100+ items) | Value Lever Map (15–20 levers) |
| "We do everything" | "What will move YOUR numbers?" |
| 12–18 month rollout | 60–90 day lever activation |
| Unclear ROI attribution | KPI ↔ Lever causality |
| Post-go-live: "now what?" | Pre-defined success metrics |

**The Result:**
- Traditional: 30–40% feature adoption, unclear ROI
- Move-as-One: 3–5 levers activated, 5–15% cost reduction tracked

## Slide 9: Live Light Diagnostic (Interactive)

**Headline:** Let's run your Value Lever Audit now

**On-screen: 10-question diagnostic**

**Instructions:**
"I'm going to ask you 10 quick questions across 4 pillars. For each, choose the option that best describes your current state."

**Sample Questions Displayed:**

**Cost & Productivity:**
1. How do you currently source spot freight?
   - [ ] Phone calls, no transparency (0 pts)
   - [ ] Email bidding with 3–5 vendors (1 pt)
   - [ ] Digital bidding platform (2 pts)

2. What % of your shipments are LTL (less than truckload)?
   - [ ] >40% (0 pts)
   - [ ] 25–40% (1 pt)
   - [ ] <25% (2 pts)

**Service & Experience:**
3. What's your current OTIF %?
   - [ ] <75% (0 pts)
   - [ ] 75–88% (1 pt)
   - [ ] >88% (2 pts)

**[Continue for all 10 questions]**

**Live Scoring:**
As answers are given, show running total:
- Cost: X/6
- Service: X/6
- Efficiency: X/4
- Risk: X/4

        /  \
   Risk/    \Service
       \    /
        \  /
         \/
      Efficiency
```

**Maturity Levels:**
- Level 1 (Foundational): 0–33% | Red zone
- Level 2 (Emerging): 34–66% | Amber zone
- Level 3 (Advanced): 67–100% | Green zone

**Example Output:**
- **Cost & Productivity**: Level 1 (33%) - Fragmented sourcing, limited lane visibility
- **Service & Experience**: Level 2 (50%) - Moderate OTIF, reactive exception management
- **Efficiency**: Level 1 (25%) - Low utilization, high LTL%, poor yard throughput
- **Risk & Compliance**: Level 2 (62%) - Good doc compliance, but detention exposure

**Recommended Levers (Top 3):**
1. **LU10**: LTL→FTL Consolidation → Est. -10–15% PKMMT
2. **TB01**: Digital Spot Bidding → Est. -5–8% spot cost
3. **YG52**: Gate Scheduling → Est. -35–50% detention

## Slide 11: Next Steps - Data-backed Simulation

**Headline:** Want to see this on YOUR actual network?

**What we'll do:**

**Step 1: Data Extract** (5–10 minutes of your IT team's time)
- 3–6 months of shipment data
- Fields: origin, destination, date, weight, vehicle type, freight cost
- **No sensitive business logic or contracts needed**

**Step 2: Analysis** (We do this, 3–5 business days)
- Baseline KPIs (C02, E01, E04, S01, etc.)
- Lever opportunity analysis (LU10, TB01, RS19, etc.)
- Simulated impact ranges on YOUR lanes

**Step 3: Results Presentation** (45-minute session)
- Customized output: "If you activate LU10 on these 8 lanes → Est. ₹X–Y savings, Z% OTIF gain"
- Roadmap: Which levers to activate in what sequence
- Business case: ROI, payback period, risk assessment

**Timeline:** 2 weeks from data share to presentation

## Slide 12: Closing - Why This Matters

**Headline:** Most TMS vendors sell features. We sell outcomes.

**Key Differentiators:**

✅ **Value-lever-first** (not feature-first)
✅ **Causal attribution** (KPI ↔ Lever mapping)
✅ **Industry benchmarks** (5–15% cost, 3–5 pt OTIF)
✅ **Diagnostic before demo** (fit before features)
✅ **60–90 day activation** (not 12-month rollouts)

**Call to Action:**

"Let's schedule the data-backed simulation. You'll get a one-page output showing:
- Your baseline KPIs
- Top 3–5 levers for YOUR network
- Expected impact ranges with confidence intervals
- Activation roadmap

Even if you don't move forward with Fretron, you'll have a clear view of where your leverage is."
