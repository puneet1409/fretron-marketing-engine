# Move-as-One Command Center – Master PRD & GTM v5 (Dispatch Edition, Sales-Integrated)

> v5 = v4 **plus** hardening for differentiation, leadgen, and conversion in the Indian mid‑market. This version:
> - Sharpens the **external wedge offer** (Dispatch Value Audit).
> - Reduces what we expose early (simple outcomes + 5–7 levers) and hides complexity.
> - Adds a **sales field guide layer** (scripts, constraints, proof requirements).
> - Emphasises small‑scope, proof‑driven pilots.

## 0. Executive Summary – How This Helps Us Win

**Goal:** Make Fretron’s Move‑as‑One product & framework a *practical weapon* for:

- **Leadgen:** A concrete, low‑friction offer (“Dispatch Value Audit”) that resonates with mid‑market Indian shippers.
- **Conversion:** A product‑led sales motion where prospects see their problems, levers, and business case inside the platform.
- **Delivery:** A controlled path from pilot to full deployment via levers, ladders, and readiness – not a big‑bang TMS sale.

We deliberately separate:

- **External story (what we say outside):** simple, outcome‑driven, proof‑anchored.
- **Internal framework (how we think):** KPIs, levers, ladders, readiness, impact logic.

The rest of this doc is written for **internal consumption** to align product, sales, CS, and marketing.

## 1. External Positioning & Wedge Offer

### 1.1 Public Promise (For Mid-Market India)

We do **not** lead with “Move‑as‑One”. Externally we push a single, crisp wedge:

> **Fretron Dispatch Value Audit**  
> Find **8–15% freight cost savings** and **3–5 point OTIF uplift** on your top lanes – without ripping out your TMS.

Move‑as‑One is the **engine behind** this audit, not the headline.

### 1.2 Productised Audit Offer

We define the audit as a productised service, not a vague “consulting workshop”.

- **Name:** Fretron Dispatch Value Audit – Move‑as‑One Edition
- **Inputs:**
  - 30–45 min remote session (Light Diagnostic) with logistics/plant head, ideally CFO or supply chain head listening in.
  - Optional: 3–6 months of data for **5–10 lanes / 2–3 plants** (for simulation).
- **Outputs (promised):**
  - 1–2 page **Value Snapshot**:
    - Current levels on Cost, Service, Risk, Digital ladders.
    - 3–5 **levers** you are realistically ready to pull.
  - An **opportunity band** for those levers on those lanes (₹/year + OTIF points).
  - A **pilot proposal sketch** (scope, levers, duration).
- **SLA:**
  - “We will deliver your Dispatch Value Audit report within **7–10 working days** of the workshop (and data share if applicable).”

This is the CTA in:

- Cold outreach (email/LinkedIn)
- Landing pages
- Webinars
- Partner campaigns

### 1.3 External Messaging Constraints

To avoid “theory” perception, AEs/marketers must **NOT** lead with:

- “Lever ladders”, “maturity models”, “digital twinning” or “control towers”.

Instead, we talk about:

- **Outcomes:** “Cost per MT‑km”, “OTIF”, “detention & claims”.
- **Concrete levers:** “Better truck fill”, “smarter routing”, “cleaner spot buying”, “less detention at plants/consignees”.

Move‑as‑One terms appear **gradually** as trust builds; details in sections below.

---

## 2. Internal Framework (Unchanged Core) – Outcomes, KPIs, Levers, Ladders, Readiness

> This section is largely inherited from v4; we keep it exhaustive internally but show a *thin slice* externally.

- **Outcome Pillars:** Cost & Productivity, Service & Experience, Risk & Compliance, ESG & Digitalisation.
- **KPI Library:** Same as v4 (C01–C07, S01–S07, E01–E08, CP01–CP06, V01–V03, ESG01–03, DA01–04) with formulas.
- **Lever Library:** 11 themes (TB, LU, RS, ND, CV, CT, YG, DB, RC, SG, OC) with 80+ levers.
- **Lever Schema:** ID, name, KPIs, dependencies, teams, impact logic, etc.
- **Lever Ladders:** For each pillar, 3–4 levels with associated levers.
- **Readiness:** R/A/G on Data, SOP, Tech per lever.
- **Impact Logic:** generic Impact = Volume × Deviation × Efficiency.

These definitions in v4 stay; v5 adds **usage constraints and exposure rules**.

---

## 3. Exposure Rules – What We Show When

To avoid cognitive overload, we define a strict exposure sequence:

### 3.1 Stage 0 / Outreach

Allowed externally:

- Outcomes: cost, OTIF, detention, compliance.
- A handful of **plain-English levers**:
  - "Truck fill & consolidation"
  - "Better routing & lane selection"
  - "Disciplined spot buying"
  - "Detention hygiene"
  - "Basic tracking & proof of delivery"
- “Dispatch Value Audit” brand.

Forbidden externally at this stage:

- Detailed levers list, ladder diagrams, maturity jargon, digital twin.

### 3.2 Stage 1 / Discover (First Session)

Allowed externally:

- Simple **Value Map** slide within Value Studio:
  - 3–4 pillars → 2–3 KPIs → 2–3 levers each (no IDs, no heavy taxonomy).
- “Levers” as a concept (“knobs you can turn”).
- “Levels” language:
  - “You’re early/medium/advanced on cost/service.”

We **only show** a very light ladder representation:

- Vertical bars labelled: “Basic → Improving → Leading” per pillar.
- No 4-level complicated diagram.

Forbidden externally in Stage 1:

- Lever IDs, full library view, hardcore ladder detail.

### 3.3 Stage 2 / Design

Allowed externally now:

- Ladder term with simple description:
  - “These ladders just show us where you are and what the next step is on cost/service/risk.”
- Readiness concept:
  - Data/SOP/Tech bars per lever in KPI Design View.
- Specific lever names & rough impacts for the 2–3 levers under serious consideration.

Still hidden:

- Entire 80+ lever taxonomy.
- All non‑relevant levers.

### 3.4 Stage 3–4 / Deploy & Drive

At this point (pilot and BAU), we can safely surface:

- Ladder progress charts (how their ladders changed over time).
- More levers for future phases.
- Impact vs modeled impact per lever.

Externally, still avoid jargon; frame as:

- “Phase 1 levers we pulled.”
- “Phase 2 levers under consideration.”

## 4. Sales Field Guide Layer – How AEs/SEs Use Move-as-One

We overlay a **field guide** on the product design. This ensures the framework is usable by sales, not just product.

### 4.1 Stage 1 – Discover Call (30–45 min)

**Objectives**

- Establish credibility with **outcome-first** talk.
- Do the Light Diagnostic inside Value Studio.
- Surface 3–5 realistic levers.

**Talk track (simplified)**

1. Start with outcomes:  
   “Let’s talk about your freight cost, OTIF, and detention on your key lanes.”

2. Show simple Value Map in Value Studio:  
   “These are the outcomes, and these are the kinds of levers we’ve seen move them.”

3. Run Light Diagnostic:  
   “We’ll ask ~10 questions about how you operate today, no data or preparation needed.”

4. Show ladder‑like view without saying “maturity model”:  
   “From this, you look early stage on cost and risk; more mature on tracking and digital basics.”

5. Pitch next step:  
   “We can take a small slice of your data on 5–10 lanes and run a more detailed opportunity analysis.”

### 4.2 Stage 2 – Design Session (60–90 min)

**Objectives**

- Confirm 2–3 levers for a pilot.
- Present a banded business case.
- Get verbal alignment on a pilot scope.

**Talk track**

1. Open KPI Design View for key KPIs (C02, S04, E06):  
   “Here’s how these are performing on the sample lanes.”

2. Show candidate levers with readiness bars:  
   “These two levers (e.g. Load Optimiser, Digital Spot Bidding) have the most green readiness – they’re realistic in the next 3–6 months.”

3. Show simulation bands:  
   “If we apply them here, based on your data, we expect PKMMT to drop by 8–12% and OTIF to improve by 2–4 points.”

4. Suggest pilot:  
   “Let’s set up a 3–6 month pilot on these plants/lanes with these levers. We’ll use this Command Center view to govern it.”

We explicitly train AEs not to:

- Overpromise (“guaranteed 15%”), but to stick to **bands + examples**.
- Deluge the prospect with every lever; stay focused on 2–3.

### 4.3 Script Constraints (guardrails)

- Don’t say: “We have 80+ levers and 11 lever families.”  
  Do say: “We have a structured playbook; for you, these 2–3 levers matter first.”

- Don’t say: “We’ll do a digital twin.”  
  Do say: “We’ll simulate what would have happened on your lanes if we consolidated loads and disciplined spot buying.”

---

## 5. Proof Requirements – Stories we MUST Build

The framework only lands if we can tell 2–3 hard stories repeatedly.

### 5.1 Required Case Types

We need at least:

1. **Cost Ladder L1→L2 Case** (e.g. steel or cement):
   - Levers: Load Optimiser (C01) + Digital Spot Bidding (TB01).  
   - Scope: 5–10 lanes.  
   - Outcome: PKMMT -8–12%; LTL% down; simple payback math.

2. **Service Ladder L1→L2 Case** (e.g. FMCG):
   - Levers: Vehicle Placement Automation (V01) + Tracking & CT (CT44/46) + E‑POD.  
   - Outcome: OTIF +3–6 pts; detention down.

3. **Risk/Compliance L1→L2 Case** (e.g. existing Fretron client):
   - Levers: EWB automation, doc checks, detention visibility.  
   - Outcome: penalties down; fewer shipment holds.

These stories must be encoded into:

- Sales decks
- Value Studio demo presets
- Website case studies

Without this, Move‑as‑One remains theoretical.

---

## 6. Scope Discipline – Start Small, Grow Later

To improve conversion and avoid overwhelming prospects, we enforce:

### 6.1 Initial Deal Scope Rules

- **Levers:** Commit to 2–3 levers only for pilot.
- **KPIs:** Focus on 2–3 headline KPIs (C02, S04, E06) + 1–2 supporting.
- **Lanes/Plants:** 5–10 lanes or 2–3 plants max.
- **Time:** 3–6 months, with clear milestones.

This is the scope seen in pilot proposals, not the full product capabilities.

### 6.2 Internal Scope vs External Expectations

- Internally, we maintain full libraries and long-term ladders.  
- Externally, we talk about **Phase 1**, framed as:  
  “Let’s fix dispatch cost and OTIF on these lanes. Once we’ve done that, we can talk Phase 2.”

---

## 7. UX Updates Implied by v5

Relative to v4, we need a few UX tweaks:

### 7.1 Value Studio – Discover View

- The Value Map shows **only 5–7 hero levers**, not the full library.
- Ladder visual is simplified to three labeled segments: `Basic → Improving → Leading`.
- After diagnostic, highlight **current and next** segment only.

### 7.2 Value Studio – Design View

- Per KPI, show **at most 3–5 candidate levers**, ordered by readiness & impact.
- Readiness bars (Data/SOP/Tech) remain, but UI emphasises “Ready Now” vs “Later”.

### 7.3 Command Center – Pilot vs Full Scope

- Add a visible marker when in **Pilot View**:  
  “This view shows only pilot lanes/plants.”
- Let big boss toggle between Pilot and Global views once full deployment happens.

---

## 8. Implementation Roadmap (v5 Adjustments)

### 8.1 Phase 1 – Message & Mock (0–30 days)

- Update all outward messaging to centre on **Dispatch Value Audit**.
- Update Figma mocks:
  - Value Map with 5–7 hero levers.
  - Simplified ladders (3 segments).
  - KPI Design View with at most 3–5 candidate levers.
- Draft sales scripts for Stage 1 & 2.

### 8.2 Phase 2 – Run 2–3 Real Audits (31–60 days)

- Preferably with existing friendly accounts and 1–2 new prospects.
- Collect:
  - Qualitative feedback (did it feel theoretical or practical?).
  - Data on actual savings/service improvements (if any quick wins possible).

### 8.3 Phase 3 – Pilot + Case Build (61–120 days)

- Convert at least 1–2 audits into **live pilots**.
- Use Command Center as governance for those pilots.
- Co‑author case studies with customers as soon as results solidify.

---

This v5 spec keeps the full richness of Move‑as‑One for internal use, but layers on:

- A **simple wedge** for the market (Dispatch Value Audit).
- Strict **exposure rules** (what concepts to reveal when).
- A **field guide** so sales can actually use the framework.
- A focus on **small, proof‑driven pilots** that can be repeated and scaled.

Everything we build in product and GTM over the next quarters should align with this spine.
