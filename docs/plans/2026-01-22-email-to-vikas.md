Hi Vikas,

I've been working on a programmatic SEO strategy for Fretron and I'd like you to own and execute this initiative.

## The Opportunity

We're sitting on unique data assets that competitors don't have:
- 87 value levers with quantified impact metrics
- 36 KPIs with formulas and industry benchmarks
- Deep expertise across Steel, Chemical, and FMCG

Currently, we're invisible for key searches like "What is TMS" and "best TMS India" - SAP and Oracle dominate. Our 155+ blog posts are scattered without topical structure.

## The Proposal

Use programmatic SEO to generate **150+ pages** from our structured data:
- Lever-based content (87 pages)
- Industry-specific variants (Steel, Chemical, FMCG)
- KPI/glossary pages for topical authority
- Comparison pages (vs Locus, vs SAP, etc.)

## Technical Approach

Leverage our existing Webflow site with:
- Airtable as the data layer
- Whalesync for two-way sync to Webflow CMS
- Claude Code for content generation at scale
- Full instrumentation (GA4 + Search Console + HubSpot attribution)

## Investment Required

- **Monthly cost:** ~$100-150/mo (Webflow Business + Whalesync)
- **One-time setup:** 20-30 hours (data schema, templates, configuration)
- **Ongoing:** Weekly content review and performance monitoring

## Expected Results (90 days)

- Indexed pages: 207 → 400+
- Keywords in top 100: ~50 → 300+
- Organic traffic: 2-3x current
- Foundation for AI citation (ChatGPT, Perplexity mentioning Fretron)

## Attached

Full strategy document with:
- Technical architecture
- Content templates
- Implementation phases
- Success metrics
- Existing assets to leverage

**Next steps:** Let's set up a 30-min call to review and align on timeline. Please check our current Webflow plan (Account Settings → Billing) before we meet.

Let me know your thoughts.
