# Running ABM Programs

**Depends on**: `trust-building-principles`

## Core Insight

**ABM is trust-building at scale with named accounts. Select fewer, go deeper, coordinate channels.**

The goal is not "more accounts touched" but "right accounts moved through trust levels."

## Account Selection

### ICP Definition

Define your Ideal Customer Profile across three dimensions:

| Dimension | Questions to Answer |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Firmographic** | Revenue range? Employee count? Industry? Geography? |
| **Technographic** | Current tools? Tech maturity? Integration needs? |
| **Behavioral** | Active triggers? Prior engagement? Buying signals? |

### Signal-Based Prioritization

Not all accounts are equal. Score based on:

**Fit Signals** (static):
- Industry match
- Company size in sweet spot
- Tech stack compatibility

**Intent Signals** (dynamic):
- Leadership changes (new VP = new initiatives)
- Expansion news (new locations = new needs)
- Website visits (pricing page = active evaluation)
- Content engagement (multiple touches = interest)

**Engagement Signals** (your data):
- Email replies
- Event attendance
- Demo requests

### Account Tiering

| Tier | Count | Investment | Approach |
|------|-------|------------|----------|
| 1 | 10-25 | High | 1:1 personalized, multi-threaded |
| 2 | 50-100 | Medium | Role-based personalization |
| 3 | 200-500 | Low | Programmatic, scaled |

**Key Principle**: Better to deeply engage 20 right accounts than superficially touch 200.

## Warmup Mechanics

### The Warmup Goal

Move accounts from "Never heard of you" → "I've seen them, they seem relevant" BEFORE sales outreach.

### 90-Day Framework

```
Days 1-30:  VISIBILITY
            - Follow key contacts on LinkedIn
            - Engage with their content (genuine, not promotional)
            - Run awareness ads to account list
            - NO direct outreach yet

Days 31-60: FAMILIARITY
            - Connect with 2-3 key contacts
            - Share valuable content via DM
            - Start email sequence (value-first)
            - Monitor engagement signals

Days 61-90: INTEREST
            - Personalized outreach based on engagement
            - Soft meeting asks to engaged contacts
            - Multi-thread into buying committee
            - Hand off warm accounts to sales
```

### Multi-Threading

Don't rely on single contacts. For each Tier 1 account, engage:

| Role | Focus | Content Type |
|------|-------|--------------|
| Champion (likely buyer) | Deep engagement | Problem-solution content |
| Economic buyer (CFO/exec) | ROI/cost focus | Business case content |
| Technical influencer | Integration/security | Technical validation |
| End users | Day-to-day pain | Operational content |

## Channel Orchestration

### Channel Roles

| Channel | ABM Role | Trust Level |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Display ads | Awareness, frequency | 0→1 |
| LinkedIn organic | Familiarity, credibility | 1→2 |
| LinkedIn ads | Targeted content delivery | 1→3 |
| Email | Value delivery, conversation | 2→4 |
| Sales outreach | Conversion | 3→5 |

### Coordination Principle

Channels should reinforce, not repeat. Same account sees:
- Display ad → Brand awareness
- LinkedIn content → Your expertise
- Email → Relevant insight
- Sales call → "I've seen your content, let's talk"

## Measurement

### Leading Indicators (Weekly)

- Accounts engaged (any touch response)
- Contact coverage per account
- Content consumption
- Email/LinkedIn response rates

### Lagging Indicators (Monthly)

- Meetings booked from ABM accounts
- Pipeline created from ABM accounts
- Win rate: ABM vs non-ABM
- Deal velocity: ABM vs non-ABM

### The Real ABM Question

**Are we moving accounts through trust levels, or just touching them?**

Track trust level progression, not just activity metrics.

## Common ABM Failures

**Too many accounts**: Can't go deep enough. Cut list in half.

**Marketing-only ABM**: Sales not involved until handoff fails. Involve sales in account selection.

**Activity over outcomes**: Measuring touches instead of trust progression.

**Generic "personalization"**: {{FirstName}} isn't personalization. Account-specific insights are.

## Inbound Lead Qualification

### Quick Scoring Framework

| Dimension | High (10pts) | Medium (5pts) | Low (2pts) |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|------------|
| **Firmographic fit** | ICP match | Adjacent | Partial |
| **Role/authority** | VP+/Decision maker | Manager/Influencer | Analyst |
| **Engagement** | Multi-touch, pricing | 2-3 pages | Single visit |
| **Urgency signals** | "Evaluating now" | "Planning for Q[X]" | "Exploring" |

### Score Interpretation

| Score | Classification | Action |
|-------|----------------|--------|
| 30-40 | Hot | Sales <2 hours |
| 20-29 | Warm | SDR same-day |
| 10-19 | Cool | Nurture + SDR |
| <10 | Cold/DQ | Marketing only or archive |

### Qualification Questions

- "What prompted you to reach out now?" (trigger)
- "What's not working about current approach?" (pain)
- "Who else is involved in evaluating?" (authority)
- "What's your timeline for a decision?" (urgency)

### Instant Disqualifiers

- Student/academic
- Competitor
- Wrong geography
- No logistics need
- Consultant research

## B2B Tech Context

**For SaaS**: Focus on tech stack compatibility, integration triggers
**For logistics/ops**: Plant expansions, leadership changes, operational pain signals
**For enterprise**: Multi-threading critical, longer warmup, exec engagement required
