# Generating Lead Magnets

## Core Insight

**Interactive and personalized > static PDFs. The asset should provide value BEFORE they talk to sales.**

A calculator that shows their specific savings beats a generic whitepaper every time.

## Lead Magnet Hierarchy

### Tier 1: Highest Conversion (Interactive)
- **Assessments/Diagnostics** - "Maturity Scorecard"
- **Calculators/ROI Tools** - "Savings Calculator"
- **Mini-Audits** - "5-Minute Analysis"

### Tier 2: High Conversion (Actionable)
- **Templates** - "RFQ Template Pack"
- **Checklists** - "Implementation Checklist"
- **Swipe Files** - "Email Scripts"

### Tier 3: Medium Conversion (Educational)
- **Guides/Playbooks** - "Buyer's Guide"
- **Benchmark Reports** - "Industry Benchmarks"
- **Gated Case Studies** - "ROI Breakdown"

## Design Principles

### 1. Narrow Problem Focus
**Good**: "How much are you losing on consolidation opportunities?"
**Bad**: "Improve your logistics"

### 2. Promise Quick Win
What can they DO with this in 10 minutes?
**Good**: "Calculate your savings in 5 minutes"
**Bad**: "Learn about optimization"

### 3. Deliver Immediate Value
Value arrives BEFORE sales conversation, not gated behind it.

### 4. Create Natural Next Step
The lead magnet creates desire for more: demo, audit, conversation.
