# Jen Abel's Enterprise Sales Framework

Practical enterprise sales insights for startups selling to large organizations.

## Core Philosophy

**Enterprise sales is about influence, not features.** The buyer's internal politics, career growth, and organizational dynamics matter more than your product capabilities.

## The 15 Enterprise Sales Principles

### Talent & Team

**1. Best Enterprise Talent is in Consulting Firms**
> "Some of the best enterprise sales talent is sitting in management consulting firms — filtering for agency and creativity is key."

- Look for consultants transitioning to tech
- They understand enterprise buying dynamics
- Filter for: initiative, creativity, entrepreneurial drive
- Avoid: those who need rigid structure

### Deal Sizing & Strategy

**2. Truncate Deals to Land Fast**
> "Truncating deals is the fastest way into enterprise, then expand — land $100K-300K — NOT $10K or $1MM."

**The Land-and-Expand Sweet Spot:**
| Deal Size | Problem |
|-----------|---------|
| $10K | Too small to matter, no executive attention |
| $100K-300K | Sweet spot: meaningful but approvable |
| $1MM+ | Too big for first deal, long approval cycles |

**Strategy:**
- Start with a single use case or department
- Prove value quickly
- Expand to adjacent teams
- Build to enterprise-wide deals

### Qualification Criteria

**3. Founder Involvement is Competitive Advantage**
> "Founders involved in the sales process is a natural competitive advantage — driving OR sharing vision roadmap."

When to deploy founders:
- Strategic accounts (Tier 1)
- Deals that need differentiation
- When buyer wants to understand product vision
- Negotiation stalemates

**4. Cell Phone Number = Qualified**
> "If you don't have one of their cell numbers, it's not qualified."

This signals:
- Real relationship, not just vendor interaction
- Access for urgent conversations
- Trust established
- Champion identified

**5. Pitch Differentiation and Alpha**
> "Differentiation and alpha is what you pitch — this is what execs get excited about."

Executives care about:
- What you do that no one else does
- Competitive advantage they gain
- Strategic differentiation, not features
- "Alpha" = outsized returns others can't get

**6. N or N-1 Level = Qualified**
> "If you're not speaking to N or N-1, it's not qualified. Influence is everything."

**N = Decision Maker, N-1 = Direct Report to Decision Maker**

| Level | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| N-3 | Information gatherers, no influence |
| N-2 | May recommend, rarely decide |
| N-1 | Strong influence, can champion |
| N | Signs the check |

**Action:** If stuck at N-3, ask: "Who else should be involved in this evaluation?"

### Sales Cycle Management

**7. Enterprise Deals in 3-6 Months**
> "Enterprise deals can get done in 3-6 months — 9+ months is self-inflicted."

**What causes 9+ month cycles (self-inflicted):**
- Wrong stakeholder level (N-3 instead of N)
- No compelling event/urgency
- Scope creep (started small, ballooned)
- Champion not enabled to sell internally
- Legal/procurement started too late

**How to close in 3-6 months:**
- Identify compelling event early
- Get to N or N-1 immediately
- Truncate initial scope
- Enable your champion with materials
- Parallel process: legal/security while piloting

**8. Discounting Rarely Impacts Demand**
> "Discounting seldom impacts market demand."

- Price cuts don't create urgency
- Urgency comes from business need
- Discounting signals desperation
- Focus on value, not price

---

### Buyer Psychology

**9. Build for Customer, Not Boss**
> "Corporates build for the boss, startups build for the customer — remember this."

**Implication for Sales:**
- Your buyer's internal customer is their boss
- Understand what makes their boss look good
- Position your solution as making buyer successful with their leadership
- Your champion needs to look smart for bringing you in

**10. Tier 1 Logos ARE Early Adopters**
> "Tier 1 logos are often the early enterprise adopters for startups."

Counterintuitive truth:
- Big companies have innovation budgets
- They actively seek competitive advantage
- Smaller companies are often more risk-averse
- Don't assume enterprise = slow adopter

**11. High Win Rate is NOT Positive**
> "A high win rate (>50%) is often NOT a positive signal — it suggests price OR market size is very off."

| Win Rate | Signal |
|----------|--------|
| <20% | Product-market or messaging issue |
| 20-40% | Healthy — competitive, right market |
| 40-50% | Strong — may be leaving money on table |
| >50% | Red flag — pricing too low or market too narrow |

**12. New Product = Growing Their Influence**
> "Bringing in a new product is all about growing/expanding their influence in the organization."

**The Champion's Real Motivation:**
- They look innovative by bringing you in
- Success with your product = their promotion
- They're betting their reputation on you
- Make them the hero, not your product

---

### Deal Execution

**13. Word Doc Before DocuSign**
> "If selling to enterprise, you never send the DocuSign, you send a WORD doc first — will add 2 weeks to sales cycle."

**Enterprise Contract Process:**
1. Send editable Word doc (not PDF)
2. Let legal redline
3. Negotiate changes
4. Only then convert to signing format

**Why:**
- Legal needs to make edits
- PDF/DocuSign signals "take it or leave it"
- Word doc signals "we're flexible partners"
- Builds goodwill, reduces friction

**14. Net 60 is Standard**
> "Net 60 is typically their pay cycle, unless you want to offer 2-3% concession for shorter timeframe."

**Payment Terms Strategy:**
| Terms | Approach |
|-------|----------|
| Net 30 | Offer 2-3% discount |
| Net 45 | Offer 1% discount |
| Net 60 | Standard — accept |
| Net 90+ | Push back, negotiate |

**15. Educate Procurement**
> "Educate procurement as much as you can — the first paper they send you often has many clauses unrelated to you — explain why not relevant — they are expecting this."

**How to Handle Procurement:**
- Read every clause in their template
- Many clauses are generic (manufacturing, hardware, etc.)
- Politely explain what's not applicable
- Procurement expects pushback — it's professional
- Builds relationship by showing you read carefully
