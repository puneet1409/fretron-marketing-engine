# Writing Persuasive Copy

**Depends on**: `trust-building-principles`

## Core Insight

**Lead with capability (what they can DO), not features or vague benefits.**

Feature: "Real-time GPS tracking"
Capability: "See every shipment's location without calling anyone"
Benefit: "Save 20 hours/week on tracking calls"

The chain: Capability → Feature (proof) → Benefit (outcome)

## Direct Response Principles

### PAS: Problem → Agitate → Solution

1. **Problem**: State the pain clearly
2. **Agitate**: Make it feel urgent/costly
3. **Solution**: Present your answer

### Hook Formulas

| Formula | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Specific number + outcome | "8-15% cost reduction in 90 days" |
| Question exposing pain | "How much are you losing to X?" |
| Contrarian statement | "Your TMS isn't the problem" |
| Timeframe + outcome | "Go live in 6 weeks, not 6 months" |
| Social proof lead | "How [Company] cut costs by 12%" |

### Copy Quality Checklist

Before publishing:
- [ ] Hook grabs attention in 3 seconds
- [ ] Clear who this is for
- [ ] Specific outcome promised
- [ ] Proof included (numbers, quotes, logos)
- [ ] Single clear CTA
- [ ] "You" language throughout
- [ ] Reads at 6th-8th grade level

## Voice Consistency

### Define 3-5 Voice Attributes

Example B2B tech voice:
- **Direct**: Get to the point
- **Confident**: We know our domain
- **Practical**: Focus on action
- **Approachable**: Expert but not arrogant

### Voice Spectrum

| We Are | We Aren't |
|--------|-----------|
| Direct | Blunt |
| Confident | Arrogant |
| Expert | Jargon-heavy |
| Outcome-focused | Salesy |

### Language Rules

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| Utilize | Use |
| Leverage | Use, Apply |
| Innovative | (show, don't tell) |
| Best-in-class | (prove it) |
| Seamlessly | (skip) |

## Channel Adaptation

### Landing Pages
- Outcome-focused headline
- Specific numbers
- Social proof visible
- Single CTA (repeated)
- Trust-matched ask

### Ads (LinkedIn/Google)
- Lead with question or stat
- 1-2 short sentences
- Clear value proposition
- Specific CTA

### Sales Emails
- Research visible in first line
- Short paragraphs
- One idea per email
- Easy next step

### Product UI
- Ultra-clear
- Task-focused
- No marketing speak

## CTA Calibration

Match CTA to trust level:

| Trust Level | CTA Examples |
|-------------|--------------|
| 0-1 | "Read more", "See how" |
| 2 | "Get the guide", "Calculate savings" |
| 3 | "Book 15 min", "Get audit" |
| 4 | "Request demo", "Talk to expert" |
| 5 | "Start pilot", "Get proposal" |

## The "So What?" Test

For every claim, ask "So what?" until you reach something the reader cares about.

"We have AI-powered analytics" → So what?
"You can see patterns in your data" → So what?
"You'll catch problems before they cost you money" ← This.

## B2B Tech Context

- Use industry-specific metrics and benchmarks
- Reference common pain points by vertical
- Specific numbers beat vague claims
- Case studies from same industry hit harder

## Integration

- Trust-matched CTAs → `trust-building-principles`
- Email copy → `writing-b2b-emails`
- Content copy → `seo-and-content-strategy`
