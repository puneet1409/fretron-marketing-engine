# Defining ICP and Tiers

**Depends on**: `trust-building-principles`

## Core Insight

**ABM is about replicating your best deals. The key difference between good and bad ABM is how accounts are sourced. Build a list of accounts that have need AND that you can win and retain.**

## The 6 Pillars Framework

### Pillar 1: Firmographic & Demographic Criteria

Replicate best deals by analyzing won deal patterns:

| Dimension | Questions |
|-----------|-----------|
| Company size | Employee range? Revenue range? Sweet spot? |
| Industry | Which verticals have highest win rate? |
| Geography | Regions that close faster? |
| Volume | Usage thresholds that make sense? |
| Tech stack | Current solutions? ERP presence? |

### Pillar 2: Qualification & Disqualification

**Qualification signals**: Pain point indicators, technology readiness, buying signals (leadership changes, expansion), organizational fit (budget authority)

**Disqualification red flags**: Recently implemented competitor (<12 mo), long-term contract lock, company distress, too small, 100% outsourced function

### Pillar 3: Buying Committee

Enterprise deals average 14+ people. Map:

| Role | Typical Titles | Priority |
|------|----------------|----------|
| Champion | VP, Director | Critical |
| Executive sponsor | C-suite | Critical |
| Finance | CFO, Controller | High |
| IT/Technical | CIO, IT Director | High |
| End users | Managers, Team Leads | Medium |
| Potential blocker | Incumbent champion | Watch |

### Pillar 4: Account Tiering

| Tier | Criteria | Program | Count |
|------|----------|---------|-------|
| Tier 1 | Highest ACV, strategic logo, complex | Fully personalized 1:1 | 10-20 |
| Tier 2 | Good ACV, industry fit | Micro-segment campaigns | 30-50 |
| Tier 3 | Standard ACV, single location | Vertical campaigns, scaled | 100-200 |

**Tiering components**: Deal value (40%), strategic logo value (20%), tech readiness (15%), signal strength (15%), complexity (10%)

### Pillar 5: Jobs To Be Done

| JTBD | Trigger | Champion | Messaging Focus |
|------|---------|----------|-----------------|
| Cost reduction | CFO mandate, margin pressure | Finance | ROI, savings, payback |
| Growth enablement | Rapid growth, scaling constraints | Ops, COO | Scale without headcount |
| Risk mitigation | Penalties, compliance, audit | Operations | SLAs, visibility |
| Digital transformation | Board mandate, competitive pressure | CIO | Modern, fast implementation |

### Pillar 6: Buyer Journey & Channels

Interview won customers:
- What event created the need?
- Who raised the problem internally?
- What factors influenced the decision?
- What almost caused you NOT to buy?
- Where do you learn about technology?

Map journey: Problem Recognition → Solution Exploration → Vendor Evaluation → Decision

## ICP Documentation

Define your ICP with:
- **Firmographics**: Industry tiers, size ranges, geography, volume thresholds
- **Technographics**: Current solutions, tech stack, IT maturity
- **Qualification**: Must-haves, nice-to-haves, disqualifiers
- **Buying committee**: Champion titles, sponsor, stakeholders
- **JTBD**: Primary and secondary jobs
- **Journey**: Typical trigger, decision factors, preferred channels

## Integration

- After ICP defined → `selecting-and-researching-accounts`
- For JTBD messaging → `writing-persuasive-copy`
- For buying committee engagement → `enabling-champions`
