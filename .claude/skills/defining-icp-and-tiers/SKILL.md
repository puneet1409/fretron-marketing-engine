# Defining ICP and Tiers

**Depends on**: `trust-building-principles`

## Core Insight

**ABM is about replicating your best deals and expanding your best customers. The key difference between good and bad ABM is how accounts are sourced.**

Build a list of accounts that have **need** for your solution and that you can reasonably **win and retain**.

## The 6 Pillars Framework (Full Funnel)

### Pillar 1: Firmographic & Demographic Criteria

**Why**: Replicate your best deals by analyzing patterns from won deals.

| Dimension | Questions to Answer |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Company Size** | Employee range? Revenue range? Sweet spot? |
| **Industry** | Which verticals have highest win rate? |
| **Geography** | Regions that close faster? Clusters? |
| **Volume** | Transaction/shipment/user thresholds? |
| **Tech Stack** | Current solutions? ERP presence? |

### Pillar 2: Qualification & Disqualification Criteria

**Qualification Signals** (Must Have):
- Pain point indicators visible (job postings, complaints, manual processes)
- Technology readiness (ERP, digital initiatives, IT team size)
- Buying signals (leadership changes, expansion, relevant hiring)
- Organizational fit (budget authority, team structure)

**Disqualification Red Flags**:
- Recently implemented competitor (<12 months)
- Locked in long-term contract
- Company in distress (bankruptcy, downsizing)
- Too small to justify cost
- 100% outsourced function

### Pillar 3: Buying Committee Mapping

**In enterprise, 14+ people average comprise buying committee.**

| Role | Typical Titles | Priority | When Needed |
|------|----------------|----------|-------------|
| **Champion** | VP Ops, Director, Manager | Critical | Problem identification |
| **Executive Sponsor** | CFO, COO, CEO | Critical | Budget approval |
| **Finance** | Controller, Finance Manager | High | ROI validation |
| **IT/Technical** | CIO, IT Director | High | Integration approval |
| **End Users** | Plant Managers, Team Leads | Medium | Problem validation |
| **Procurement/Legal** | Procurement, Legal | Medium | Vendor confirmation |
| **Potential Blocker** | Incumbent champion, Status quo advocate | Watch | Identify early |

### Pillar 4: Account Tiering

**An account worth $500K annually should not be marketed the same as a $50K account.**

| Tier | Criteria | Program | Target Count |
|------|----------|---------|--------------|
| **Tier 1** | Highest ACV potential, strategic logo value, multi-location | Fully personalized 1:1, executive engagement, custom content | 10-20 accounts |
| **Tier 2** | Good ACV potential, industry fit, moderate complexity | Micro-segment campaigns, role-based personalization | 30-50 accounts |
| **Tier 3** | Standard ACV, single location, experimental segments | Vertical-based campaigns, scaled content, limited personalization | 100-200 accounts |

**Tiering Score Components**:
- Potential deal value (40%)
- Strategic logo value (20%)
- Technology readiness (15%)
- Buying signal strength (15%)
- Multi-location complexity (10%)

### Pillar 5: Jobs To Be Done (JTBD)

**Enterprise companies buy for different reasons. Understanding JTBD enables personalized messaging.**

| JTBD | Trigger | Champion | Messaging Focus |
|------|---------|----------|-----------------|
| **Cost Reduction** | CFO mandate, margin pressure | Finance, CFO | ROI, savings, payback period |
| **Growth Enablement** | Rapid growth, scaling constraints | VP Ops, COO | Scale without headcount, automation |
| **Risk Mitigation** | Penalties, compliance issues, audit findings | Operations, Quality | SLAs, visibility, compliance |
| **Digital Transformation** | Board mandate, competitive pressure | CIO, CDO | Modern SaaS, fast implementation, API |

### Pillar 6: Buyer Journey & Channel Presence

**Market and sell the way your best customers buy.**

Questions for won customer interviews:
1. What event or shift created the need?
2. Who first raised the problem internally?
3. Who was involved in evaluating solutions?
4. What factors influenced the decision?
5. What almost caused you NOT to buy?
6. Where do you learn about technology?
7. What events/communities do you follow?

**Map the typical journey stages**:
- Problem Recognition → Solution Exploration → Vendor Evaluation → Decision/Procurement
