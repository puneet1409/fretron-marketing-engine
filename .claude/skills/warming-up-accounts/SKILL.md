# Warming Up Accounts

**Depends on**: `selecting-and-researching-accounts`, `trust-building-principles`

## Core Insight

**Cold outreach to warm accounts converts 3-5x better than truly cold. Invest 30-90 days building familiarity before asking for meetings.**

## The 90-Day Framework

| Phase | Days | Goal | Trust Level |
|-------|------|------|-------------|
| **Research & Listening** | 1-30 | Build intelligence, passive presence | 0 → 1 |
| **Light Engagement** | 31-60 | Create familiarity, demonstrate relevance | 1 → 2 |
| **Value Delivery** | 61-90 | Deliver tangible value, earn conversation | 2 → 3 |

### Phase 1: Research & Listening
- Map company, org structure, triggers
- Identify buying committee members
- Follow, observe, occasional likes (no engagement yet)

### Phase 2: Light Engagement
- Meaningful comments that add value
- Connection requests with personalization
- First DMs: value-focused, no ask

### Phase 3: Value Delivery
- Custom insights for their situation
- Ask for perspective (flattering, not selling)
- Warm transition to conversation

## Warmup Plays

### Podcast Play (1-to-1)

**Why it works**: They're the expert, not the prospect. You learn their challenges while building relationship.

**Core elements**:
- Pre-production interview = discovery call in disguise
- Make them the hero of the story
- Ask for referrals at end of interview
- Follow up with value, then soft pitch

**Metrics that matter**: Acceptance rate (70-80% target), opportunities created. NOT downloads.

### Market Research Play (1-to-Few)

**Why it works**: Co-create valuable content while learning about challenges.

**Core elements**:
- 20-30 min interviews or survey fallback
- Compile insights into report
- Activate: webinar, personalized follow-ups, direct mail

**Use for**: New accounts, existing customers (expansion), stalled opportunities.

### Meaningful Commenting Play

**Good comment**: Adds insight, asks question, references their specific point.
**Bad comment**: Generic ("Great post!"), self-promotional, no value added.

**Cadence**: 2-3 meaningful comments per week. Respond to replies.

### Direct Mail Play (1-to-1)

**When to use**: Last resort for qualified accounts that haven't responded digitally.

**Requirements**:
- Personalization from prior conversations
- Gift connected to personal interests (not generic swag)
- Track delivery, call within 24 hours

## Account Warmth Scoring

| Signal | Points |
|--------|--------|
| LinkedIn connection accepted | +10 |
| Responded to DM | +15 |
| Website visit | +15 |
| Content download | +20 |
| Replied to email | +20 |
| Agreed to call | +25 |
| Multiple contacts engaged | +15 |

**Thresholds**: 0-40 = Cold/Warming, 41-60 = Warm, 61+ = Hot (sales outreach appropriate)

## Common Mistakes

- **Too fast**: Pitching before rapport
- **Too generic**: Template everything
- **Too aggressive**: Multiple touches per day
- **Too passive**: Never transitioning to conversation

## Integration

- Before warmup → Build list with `selecting-and-researching-accounts`
- For trust calibration → Use `trust-building-principles`
- For email sequences → Use `writing-b2b-emails`
- For events → Use `running-abm-events`
