# Warming Up Accounts

**Depends on**: `selecting-and-researching-accounts`, `trust-building-principles`

## Core Insight

**Move accounts from "Never heard of you" to "I've seen them, they seem relevant" BEFORE sales outreach. Cold outreach to warm accounts converts 3-5x better than truly cold.**

## The 90-Day Warmup Framework

### Phase Overview

```
PHASE 1: RESEARCH & LISTENING (Days 1-30)
Goal: Build intelligence, establish passive presence
Trust Level: 0 → 1
Touchpoints: 8-12

PHASE 2: LIGHT ENGAGEMENT (Days 31-60)
Goal: Create familiarity, demonstrate relevance
Trust Level: 1 → 2
Touchpoints: 10-15

PHASE 3: VALUE DELIVERY (Days 61-90)
Goal: Deliver tangible value, earn conversation
Trust Level: 2 → 3
Touchpoints: 8-12
```

### Phase 1: Research & Listening (Days 1-30)

**Week 1: Intelligence Gathering**
- Review company website, news, annual reports
- Map organizational structure
- Identify recent announcements/triggers
- Document current solutions and tech stack

**Week 2: Contact Mapping**
- Identify buying committee (LinkedIn Sales Navigator)
- Map reporting relationships
- Find key personas for each role
- Document backgrounds, interests, content themes

**Week 3-4: Light Social Signals**
- Follow company page and 3-5 key contacts
- Observe their content (no engagement yet)
- Start liking posts (1 per person per week, not spam)
- React to company news/announcements

### Phase 2: Light Engagement (Days 31-60)

**Week 5: Meaningful Comments**
```
Action: Leave thoughtful comment on contact's post
Quality: Add value, share perspective, ask question
Avoid: Generic ("Great post!") or self-promotional

Example:
"Interesting point about [topic]. We've seen similar
patterns in [industry] - the challenge is balancing
[X] with [Y]. Curious how you're handling [specific]?"
```

**Week 6: Connection Requests**
```
Action: Connect with 2-3 key contacts
Message: Personalized, reference specific content

Template:
"Hi [Name], I've been following your posts on [topic] -
particularly liked your point about [specific insight].
I work with [industry] companies on [area].
Would love to connect and learn from your perspective."
```

**Week 7-8: Initial Value Signals**
- Share relevant content (occasionally tag if highly relevant)
- First DM: Value-focused, no ask
```
"Hi [Name], saw your post about [topic]. We just published
some benchmark data on [related topic] that might be useful.
Happy to share if interested - no strings attached."
```

### Phase 3: Value Delivery (Days 61-90)

**Week 9: Personalized Value**
- Custom insight specific to their situation
- Industry benchmark with their segment highlighted
- Introduction to peer (if appropriate)

**Week 10: Deeper Engagement**
```
Ask for perspective (flattering, not selling):

"Hi [Name], I'm putting together insights on [topic
they care about]. Given your experience with [their
situation], I'd value your perspective. Would you have
10 minutes for a quick call? Just trying to understand
the [industry] view better."
```

**Week 11-12: Transition to Conversation**
```
Warm outreach:

"Hi [Name], based on our exchanges, it seems like
[specific challenge] is on your radar. We've been
helping [industry] companies with exactly this.

Not sure if there's a fit, but would you be open to
a brief call to explore? No pressure - happy to just
share what we're seeing in the market."
```

## Warmup Play #2: Meaningful Commenting

### The Right Way
- Add genuine insight or perspective
- Ask thoughtful follow-up questions
- Share relevant experience (not pitch)
- Reference their specific point

### Examples

**Good Comment**:
```
"This resonates - we've seen similar patterns with
[industry] clients. The key inflection point seems
to be when [specific observation]. Curious if you've
found the same, or if [their industry] dynamics differ?"
```

**Bad Comment**:
```
"Great post! 👏" (Generic)
"We solve this problem at [Company]!" (Self-promotional)
"Totally agree!" (No value added)
```

### Commenting Cadence
- 2-3 meaningful comments per week across target accounts
- Respond to replies to build conversation
- Don't over-engage same person (looks desperate)

---

## Warmup Play #3: Podcast (1-to-1)

**The most powerful 1-to-1 warmup tactic. Forget downloads and views - one podcast guest who becomes a $300K deal makes it worthwhile.**

### Why Podcast Works for ABM

- Connect with target buyers on THEIR terms (they're the expert, not the prospect)
- Learn challenges, needs, priorities through genuine conversation
- Build relationship before any sales conversation
- They become your advocate (guests share episodes with their network)
- Create case-study-quality content with easy approval

### 11-Step Podcast Playbook

**Step 1: Narrow Down Focus**
- Target vertical (e.g., SaaS companies in North America)
- Account tier (e.g., Tier 1 accounts, 1000+ employees)
- Single role to start (e.g., VPs of Operations)

**Step 2: Create Podcast Brief**
- Podcast name/description and positioning
- Process explanation for guests
- Social proof (previous guests, logos)
- FAQ for communications team approval
- Topics you'll discuss

**Step 3: Seed with Warm Guests**
- Start with existing customers (easier to get, builds credibility)
- Industry influencers you know
- Build social proof before approaching cold targets

**Step 4: Engage Before Inviting**
- Comment thoughtfully on target's posts
- React to company news they share
- Build passive familiarity before cold invite

**Step 5: Use Referrals for 70-80% Acceptance**
```
"Hi [Mutual Connection], I'm running a podcast series
featuring [role] leaders. I noticed you're connected to
[Target Name] - do you think they'd be a good fit?

Would you mind if I mentioned your name when
reaching out to them?"
```

**Step 6: Collect Personalization Insights**
- Search for previous interviews they've done
- Note topics they've spoken about publicly
- Identify personal interests (football team, hobbies)
- Find achievements they're proud of

**Step 7: Run Pre-Production Interview**
This is actually a discovery call in disguise:
- "Who's responsible for [area] at your company?"
- "What are your biggest challenges with [topic]?"
- "What tech stack are you using?"
- "What achievements are you most proud of?"
- "What are your priorities for this year?"

**Step 8: Run Main Interview**
- Make them the hero of the story
- Frame as: "X things [Company] did to achieve [Result]"
- Dig into the "how" - surface-level answers aren't valuable
- Ask about their favorite pastimes (for personalized follow-up gifts)

**Step 9: Ask for Referrals (End of Interview)**
```
"By the way, I saw you're connected to [Name].
Do you think they'd be a good fit for our podcast?

Would you mind if I email them and CC you?"
```

**Step 10: Multi-Touch Follow-Up**
- Day 1: Thank-you email
- Day 3: LinkedIn recommendation praising them as guest
- Day 7: Share episode, tag them
- Day 14: Connect with their buying committee members using the episode
- Day 21: Personalized gift based on personal interests discovered

**Step 11: Soft Pitch (After Relationship Built)**
```
"You mentioned struggling with [challenge from interview].
That made me think of [Client] where we helped them
[specific result].

I sat down with my team and came up with some ideas
for how we could help you with [specific situation].
Would you be open to a separate call to explore?"
```

## Warmup Play #4: Direct Mail (1-to-1)

**Last resort for highly qualified accounts that haven't responded to digital plays. Personalized physical mail cuts through digital noise.**

### When to Use Direct Mail

- Account fits ICP perfectly
- Multiple digital plays haven't generated response
- You have personalization insights from previous interactions
- High potential deal value justifies investment

### Direct Mail Playbook

**Step 1: Select Accounts Strategically**
- Only Tier 1 accounts with validated fit
- Must have personalization insights
- Decision maker address must be verified

**Step 2: Personalize Deeply**
Base personalization on insights gathered from:
- Pre-production podcast interviews
- Social media research
- Previous conversations
- Personal interests (hobbies, sports teams, family)

**Example**: Guest mentioned loving Manchester United and spending time with family building things → Send LEGO set with Star Trek characters (they were in tech/data)

**Step 3: Include Personalized Proposal**
- Reference specific challenges they mentioned
- Connect to relevant case study
- Include clear next step

**Step 4: Track and Follow Up**
```
Day 0: Send package (track delivery)
Day 1-2: Call after delivery confirmed
Script: "Did you receive the package?"
- If yes → "Would you like me to walk you through the proposal?"
- If no → "Let me check with the office administrator"
Day 3-5: Email follow-up with same content digitally
```

### Direct Mail Success Factors

| Factor | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| Personalization | Must reference specific insights from conversations |
| Gift relevance | Connected to personal interests, not generic swag |
| Proposal quality | Addresses their specific challenges |
| Follow-up speed | Call within 24 hours of delivery |
| Tracking | Know exactly when package arrives |

**Response Rate**: With proper warmup and personalization, expect near 100% response (though not all will be opportunities).

**Too Generic**:
- "Great post!" comments
- Mass connection requests
- Template DMs without personalization

**Too Aggressive**:
- Multiple touches per day
- Following up too quickly
- Ignoring "no" signals

**Too Passive**:
- Only liking, never commenting
- Never transitioning to conversation
- 90+ days with no progress
