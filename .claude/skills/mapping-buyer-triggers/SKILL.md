# Mapping Buyer Triggers

## Core Insight

**Buyers don't buy products. They hire products to make progress. For change to happen: PUSH + PULL > ALLEGIANCE + ANXIETY**

Strong triggers create urgency. Weak triggers = nurture, not push.

## The Four Forces

```
PUSH (from current situation)     PULL (toward new solution)
"This isn't working anymore"  →   "This looks better"

           ↓ Must exceed ↓

ALLEGIANCE (to current)           ANXIETY (about new)
"We know how this works"      ←   "What if it fails?"
```

## Trigger Categories

### Pain Triggers
- **Cost pressure** - CFO asking hard questions
- **Operational chaos** - Team burning out
- **Customer complaints** - OTIF dropping, penalties
- **Visibility gaps** - Can't answer basic questions

### Event Triggers (Highest Priority)
- **Leadership change** - New exec, new initiatives (90-day window)
- **Scale change** - Volume spike, expansion, new locations
- **Strategic initiative** - Digital transformation, ERP upgrade
- **Failure event** - Lost customer, audit findings, crisis

### Comparison Triggers
- **Competitive pressure** - Competitor using better tech
- **Peer influence** - Industry event, peer company implemented

## Jobs-to-be-Done

### Functional Jobs
- "Help me see what's happening"
- "Help me control costs"
- "Help me hit delivery targets"
- "Help me run efficiently"

### Emotional Jobs
- "Help me look competent"
- "Help me feel in control"
- "Help me grow my career"

## Trigger Qualification

### Strong Triggers (Prioritize)
- [ ] Specific event identified
- [ ] Executive sponsor with timeline
- [ ] Budget allocated or process clear
- [ ] Consequences of inaction are clear
- [ ] Multiple stakeholders involved

### Weak Triggers (Nurture)
- [ ] "Just exploring options"
- [ ] No specific event or timeline
- [ ] Single person, no exec involvement
- [ ] Current pain is tolerable
- [ ] No consequence for status quo

## Discovery Questions

**Situation**: "What prompted you to look at this now?"
**Pain**: "What's not working? What does it cost you?"
**Event**: "Was there a specific event that triggered this?"
**Timeline**: "Is there a deadline this connects to?"
**Stakeholders**: "Who else is feeling this pain?"

## Trigger + Trust Matrix

| | Low Trust | High Trust |
|---|---|---|
| **Strong Trigger** | Urgent nurture | Fast-track demo |
| **Weak Trigger** | Deprioritize | Long-term relationship |

**Strong trigger doesn't override trust requirements.** Lead with value first.
