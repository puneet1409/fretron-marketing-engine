# Trigger Discovery Guide

Interview frameworks and signal detection for identifying buyer triggers.

## The JTBD Discovery Framework

### Core Philosophy

**Job to Be Done**: Buyers don't buy products—they "hire" solutions to make progress in their lives/work.

**The Switch**: Change happens when the forces pushing toward change (Push + Pull) overcome the forces resisting change (Allegiance + Anxiety).

```
PUSH (away from current state)
    +
PULL (toward new solution)
    >
ALLEGIANCE (to current way)
    +
ANXIETY (about change/new way)
    =
SWITCH HAPPENS
```

## Trigger-Based Outreach Templates

### New Leadership Trigger

```
Subject: Congrats on the new role at [Company]

Hi [Name],

Saw you recently joined [Company] as [Title]. Congratulations!

In my experience, new logistics leaders often inherit a mix of
working processes and legacy challenges. The first 90 days can
be overwhelming—so much to assess.

We've put together a diagnostic framework that helps leaders
like you quickly identify the highest-impact opportunities.
No cost, no obligation—just a structured way to assess your
logistics operation.

Would that be useful as you get settled?

Best,
[Signature]
```

### Expansion Trigger

```
Subject: Logistics for [Company]'s expansion

Hi [Name],

Saw the news about [Company]'s [new plant / expansion /
acquisition]. Exciting growth!

Quick observation: we've seen [industry] companies underestimate
the logistics complexity that comes with this kind of growth.
New lanes, new carriers, new coordination challenges.

Thought it might be useful to share how [Similar Company] handled
a similar expansion without their logistics becoming a bottleneck.

Worth a quick call?

Best,
[Signature]
```

### Pain Signal Trigger

```
Subject: Re: [Challenge they mentioned publicly]

Hi [Name],

I came across your [LinkedIn post / interview / article] about
[specific challenge they mentioned].

It resonated because we're helping [industry] companies with
exactly this. [One sentence about how we address it.]

Not sure if you're actively looking at solutions, but if you are,
I'd be happy to share what's working for others.

Either way, appreciated your candor about the challenge—it's more
common than people admit.

Best,
[Signature]
```

## Trigger Qualification Framework

### Scoring Trigger Strength

**Push Strength** (1-10):
- How severe is the pain?
- How long have they lived with it?
- Is there a catalyst event?
- What's the cost of inaction?

**Pull Strength** (1-10):
- Do they have a vision of success?
- Have they seen proof it's possible?
- Is there executive sponsorship?
- What's the expected value?

**Allegiance Resistance** (1-10):
- How entrenched is current process?
- Who benefits from status quo?
- What habits need to change?
- What's the switching cost?

**Anxiety Level** (1-10):
- What are they afraid of?
- Have they been burned before?
- Is there political risk?
- What could go wrong?

### Trigger Score Calculation

```
Trigger Strength = (Push + Pull) - (Allegiance + Anxiety)
```

| Score | Interpretation | Action |
|-------|----------------|--------|
| 15+ | Strong trigger, likely to act | Accelerate engagement |
| 10-14 | Good trigger, needs nurturing | Build case, reduce anxiety |
| 5-9 | Weak trigger, timing unclear | Monitor, add value |
| <5 | No real trigger | Deprioritize, long-term nurture |
