# Topical Authority Building

**Depends on**: `seo-and-content-strategy`

## Core Insight

**Google doesn't rank pages. It ranks entities with authority on topics. To win in search, become THE authority on your topic cluster—not just a contributor.**

One comprehensive topic cluster beats 50 random blog posts.

## The Topical Authority Model

### Traditional SEO vs Topical Authority

| Traditional | Topical Authority |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Target keywords individually | Own entire topic areas |
| Random blog posts | Structured content clusters |
| Compete on every query | Dominate your niches |
| Hope for rankings | Engineer rankings through coverage |

### How Google Evaluates Authority

Google's systems assess:
1. **Coverage**: Do you cover the topic comprehensively?
2. **Depth**: Is each piece substantive?
3. **Connectivity**: Are pieces logically linked?
4. **Entity Recognition**: Are you associated with this topic?
5. **External Validation**: Do others cite you on this topic?

## Internal Linking Architecture

### Link Types

|-----------|---------|---------|
| Pillar → Cluster | Distribute authority | Pillar links to all clusters |
| Cluster → Pillar | Context & authority | "Learn more in our complete TMS guide" |
| Cluster → Cluster | Topical relevance | "Related: Route Optimization Basics" |
| Supporting → Cluster | Roll-up authority | Long-tail links to parent cluster |

### Link Density Guidelines

- **Pillar pages**: 20-50 internal links
- **Cluster pages**: 8-15 internal links
- **Supporting content**: 5-8 internal links

### Anchor Text Strategy

**DO**:
- Use descriptive, natural anchor text
- Vary anchor text for same destination
- Include keywords where natural

**DON'T**:
- Use "click here" or "read more"
- Over-optimize with exact match
- Link same phrase to different pages

### Link Audit Checklist

Monthly review:
- [ ] All pillar pages link to all clusters
- [ ] No orphan pages (pages with no internal links)
- [ ] No broken internal links
- [ ] New content linked from relevant existing content
- [ ] Anchor text varies and is descriptive

## Semantic SEO Layer

### Beyond Keywords: Entities and Concepts

Google understands:
- **Entities**: People, places, things, concepts
- **Relationships**: How entities connect
- **Context**: What's relevant to a topic

### Entity Optimization

For each pillar topic, establish entity coverage:

**TMS Entity Map**:
```
Core Entity: Transportation Management System
Related Entities:
├── Technology: Route optimization, GPS tracking, API, ERP
├── Processes: Dispatch, shipment, freight audit
├── Roles: Logistics manager, fleet operator, shipper
├── Companies: SAP, Oracle, Fretron, competitors
├── Concepts: OTIF, freight costs, visibility
└── Industries: FMCG, pharma, automotive, retail
```

### Content Includes Related Entities

When writing about TMS, naturally include:
- Mentions of related technologies
- References to user roles
- Industry context
- Process terminology
- Competitor awareness (for comparison intent)

### Schema for Entity Association

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Article",
  "about": {
    "@type": "SoftwareApplication",
    "name": "Transportation Management System",
    "applicationCategory": "BusinessApplication",
    "applicationSubCategory": "Logistics Software"
  },
  "mentions": [
    {"@type": "Thing", "name": "Route Optimization"},
    {"@type": "Thing", "name": "Freight Audit"},
    {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Fretron"}
  ]
}
```

## Multi-Pillar Strategy

### For Fretron: 5-Pillar Structure

```
PILLAR 1: Transportation Management System
├── 8-10 clusters on TMS features, benefits, selection

PILLAR 2: Route Optimization
├── 6-8 clusters on algorithms, implementation, ROI

PILLAR 3: Fleet Management
├── 6-8 clusters on tracking, maintenance, efficiency

PILLAR 4: Freight Cost Management
├── 6-8 clusters on audit, negotiation, optimization

PILLAR 5: Logistics Compliance (India)
├── 6-8 clusters on GST, e-way bill, regulations
```

### Pillar Interconnection

Pillars should reference each other where relevant:
- TMS pillar → mentions route optimization, links to pillar
- Fleet management → mentions TMS, links to pillar
- Creates a semantic web of authority

---

## Common Mistakes

### Content Architecture Errors

- **Pillar too thin**: Not comprehensive enough to deserve head term
- **Clusters orphaned**: Not linked properly to pillar
- **Topic drift**: Content in cluster doesn't belong there
- **Keyword cannibalization**: Multiple pages targeting same query

### Authority Building Errors

- **Impatience**: Expecting results in 1-2 months
- **Neglect**: Publishing then forgetting
- **Scattered effort**: Not concentrating on winning one topic first
- **Link hoarding**: Not linking out from pillar

---

## B2B SaaS Specifics

### Building Authority in Technical Topics

B2B requires demonstrating expertise:
- Technical accuracy is non-negotiable
- Include expert perspectives
- Reference standards and best practices
- Show understanding of buyer's world

### Multi-Persona Authority

Build authority for each stakeholder:
- **Technical authority**: IT, implementation teams
- **Business authority**: CFOs, executives
- **Operational authority**: Practitioners, users

Different clusters can target different personas within same pillar.

### Thought Leadership Integration

Use pillar content as foundation for:
- Conference presentations
- Webinar series
- LinkedIn content
- Podcast topics
- Industry report contributions

External thought leadership builds backlinks and authority to pillar content.
