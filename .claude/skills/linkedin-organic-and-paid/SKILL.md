# LinkedIn Organic and Paid

**Depends on**: `trust-building-principles`

## Core Insight

**LinkedIn is where B2B buyers want to be influenced. Organic builds credibility, paid amplifies reach and qualifies traffic from other channels.**

Organic for trust-building. Paid for scale and cross-channel synergy.

## The 2024+ LinkedIn Reality

**Critical shift**: LinkedIn's algorithm changed significantly. Corporate pages are effectively dead. AI slop is flooding the timeline. What worked 18 months ago doesn't work now.

### Founder-Led Content (Company Pages Are Dead)

Growing a company page from scratch is nearly impossible now. People follow people, not logos.

| Channel | Reality | Recommendation |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| Personal profiles | 5-10x reach of company pages | **Primary investment** |
| Company page | Near-zero organic reach | Skip until personal is working |

**Example**: Adam Robinson built 140k followers → converted to $6M ARR for RB2B. That distribution is impossible to replicate with ads or cold outreach.

**If building from scratch**:
1. Put 100% into founder's personal account
2. Post 3-5x per week minimum
3. Don't touch the corporate page until you're nailing personal content

### Content Ecosystem Strategy (Multi-Account Orchestration)

LinkedIn is capacity constrained—you hit diminishing returns after 1 post/day per account. You can't spam 20 posts like X and get linear results.

**Solution**: Run 3-5+ coordinated accounts across your team.

**Scaling progression**:

| Phase | Timeline | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Foundation | Months 1-3 | One founder posting consistently |
| Expansion | Months 4-6 | Layer in 2-3 co-founders |
| Team | Month 7+ | Incentivize employees to start posting |

**Pro tip**: Use each account to speak to different ICP subsets. Founder speaks to executives, marketing lead speaks to marketing managers, technical lead speaks to IT—total market coverage without audience fatigue.

**Example**: Beehiiv does this perfectly—Tyler Denk + entire team active = omnipresent brand perception.

Some companies pay $500 bonuses for hitting posting cadence. Consider incentivizing the behavior.

### Visual Authenticity (Proving You're Human)

With AI flooding the timeline, you need ways to certify content as human and real. Posts with relevant media (video/photo) consistently outperform text-only.

**The office-as-film-set approach**:
- Proper lighting setup
- Branded elements (Pylon painted their SF office purple)
- Designated person capturing B-roll daily
- Behind-the-scenes footage library

**Recurring visual sets** are a hook that says "this is a real person with a real company." This isn't optional anymore—it's the difference between looking AI-generated and authentic.

### Algorithm Changes (Extended Shelf Life)

Half your feed is content from days or weeks ago. LinkedIn tweaked the algorithm to extend shelf life and reduce the content treadmill.

**Implications**:

| Content Type | Shelf Life | Recommendation |
|--------------|------------|----------------|
| Evergreen topics | Weeks | Prioritize—gets second/third life |
| Trendjacking | Hours | Use sparingly for attention spikes |
| Breaking news | Dead on arrival if resurfaced | Avoid unless truly timely |

**Balance your content**: Trendjacking gets attention but evergreen content has staying power. If someone sees your "breaking news" post a week later, it's dead weight.

### Personality as Moat (Defense Against AI Slop)

ChatGPT and Claude can pump out "pretty okay" LinkedIn posts in 10 seconds. The timeline is flooded with generic AI garbage that reads fine but has zero substance.

**What AI cannot replicate**:
- Your specific metrics and outcomes
- Personal anecdotes only you can share
- Your actual writing voice and personality
- Personal interests that humanize you

**Actionable plays**:

1. **Shift from "how to" to "how I"**
   - Not: "How to improve logistics efficiency"
   - Instead: "How I reduced delivery exceptions 34% in 90 days"

2. **Share stories only you can tell**
   - Your failures, pivots, lessons
   - Specific customer conversations (anonymized)

3. **Case study posts with your own system**
   - Your results, your method, your numbers

4. **Inject personal interests selectively**
   - Your endurance training, reading habits, whatever
   - Humanizes you from "industry expert" to "real person"
   - Fast-tracks trust and rapport
   - (Gary Vee's blueberry obsession is an example)

5. **Use casual tone relative to your industry**
   - Logistics/supply chain is formal → slightly casual stands out

## Organic Presence

### Personal vs Company

| Channel | Strength | Use For |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Personal profiles | Higher reach, more trust | Thought leadership, relationship |
| Company page | Brand credibility | Product updates, social proof |

**Priority**: Personal profiles of founders/experts often outperform company pages 5-10x. See "Founder-Led Content" above for the current reality.

### Content That Works

**High engagement**:
- Contrarian takes with evidence
- Specific results/numbers (your own, not generic)
- Behind-the-scenes insights
- Frameworks and mental models
- Industry observations
- "How I did X" stories (personality moat)

**Low engagement**:
- Product announcements
- Generic tips ("5 ways to improve...")
- Obvious advice
- Self-promotional content
- AI-generated slop (readers can tell)

### Posting Principles

- **Hook**: First 2 lines must stop the scroll
- **Format**: Short paragraphs, line breaks, scannable
- **Value**: Would you save this if someone else posted it?
- **Engagement**: Ask questions, invite perspective
- **Consistency**: Regular posting > occasional viral
- **Media**: Include relevant photos/videos—outperforms text-only
- **Evergreen**: Prioritize content that works when resurfaced weeks later

### Thought Leadership Formula

```
1. Observation from your domain (specific, from experience)
2. Why it matters (so what?)
3. What to do about it (actionable)
4. Question or invitation to discuss
```

**Personality version**:
```
1. Something that happened to me/us
2. What I thought would happen vs what actually happened
3. The lesson or mental model I extracted
4. Question to the audience
```

## LinkedIn Advertising

### Campaign Types by Goal

| Goal | Campaign Type | Audience |
|------|---------------|----------|
| Awareness | Brand awareness | Broad ICP |
| Engagement | Content promotion | Interested ICP |
| Conversion | Lead gen / Website | Engaged + qualified |

### Audience Building

**Native targeting**:
- Job title / function
- Company size
- Industry
- Seniority

**Custom audiences**:
- Website visitors (Insight Tag)
- Email list matches
- Engagement retargeting
- Lookalikes

## Signal-Based Retargeting

### The Ecosystem Enhancer Strategy

**Core insight**: LinkedIn can see ALL your website traffic and layer ICP filters on top. Use it to qualify and convert traffic from Google, organic, etc.

### Framework

```
1. CAPTURE: Website visitor audiences (30/60/90/180 day)
2. QUALIFY: Layer LinkedIn ICP filters (size, seniority, industry)
3. NURTURE: 90-day trust content to qualified visitors
4. CONVERT: BoFU campaigns to engaged subset
```

### Audience Windows

| Window | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| 30 day | Hot - recent visitors, conversion focus |
| 60 day | Warm - nurture and build |
| 90 day | Standard nurture pool |
| 180 day | Extended awareness |

### Nurture Content Rotation

Over 90 days, serve:
- Thought leader content (credibility)
- Case studies (proof)
- Educational assets (value)
- Demo clips (consideration)

**Not**: Constant demo CTAs to cold audiences.

### Engagement Triggers

When someone:
- Clicks MoFU content
- Watches 75%+ of video
- Downloads asset
- Visits pricing page

→ Move to 30-day BoFU campaign with stronger CTAs.

## Cross-Channel Synergy

### LinkedIn + Google Ads

LinkedIn retargeting on Google traffic:
- Google drives in-market searches
- LinkedIn qualifies to ICP
- LinkedIn nurtures buying committee
- Result: Higher conversion on Google spend

**Math example**:
- Google only: 2% conversion
- Google + LinkedIn retargeting: 4-6% on warmed traffic
- Incremental LinkedIn return: 10-30x

### LinkedIn + ABM

Use LinkedIn as primary warmup channel for ABM:
- Organic engagement with target accounts
- Paid content to account list
- Direct outreach to warmed contacts

## Measurement

### Organic Metrics

- Impressions and reach
- Engagement rate (>2% good, >5% great)
- Profile views
- Connection requests received
- DM conversations started

### Paid Metrics

| Metric | Awareness | Engagement | Conversion |
|--------|-----------|------------|------------|
| Focus | CPM, Reach | CTR, Engagement | CPL, ROAS |
| Target | <$30 CPM | >0.5% CTR | <$100 CPL |

### Cross-Channel Attribution

Track:
- Google CPL trend (should improve with LinkedIn retargeting)
- LinkedIn-influenced pipeline in CRM
- Account coverage and impressions via Company Hub

## B2B Tech Context

- Decision-makers ARE on LinkedIn
- Technical content performs well
