# LinkedIn Organic and Paid

**Depends on**: `trust-building-principles`

## Core Insight

**LinkedIn is where B2B buyers want to be influenced. Organic builds credibility, paid amplifies reach and qualifies traffic from other channels.**

Organic for trust-building. Paid for scale and cross-channel synergy.

## Organic Presence

### Personal vs Company

| Channel | Strength | Use For |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Personal profiles | Higher reach, more trust | Thought leadership, relationship |
| Company page | Brand credibility | Product updates, social proof |

**Priority**: Personal profiles of founders/experts often outperform company pages 5-10x.

### Content That Works

**High engagement**:
- Contrarian takes with evidence
- Specific results/numbers
- Behind-the-scenes insights
- Frameworks and mental models
- Industry observations

**Low engagement**:
- Product announcements
- Generic tips
- Obvious advice
- Self-promotional content

### Posting Principles

- **Hook**: First 2 lines must stop the scroll
- **Format**: Short paragraphs, line breaks, scannable
- **Value**: Would you save this if someone else posted it?
- **Engagement**: Ask questions, invite perspective
- **Consistency**: Regular posting > occasional viral

### Thought Leadership Formula

```
1. Observation from your domain
2. Why it matters (so what?)
3. What to do about it
4. Question or invitation to discuss
```

## LinkedIn Advertising

### Campaign Types by Goal

| Goal | Campaign Type | Audience |
|------|---------------|----------|
| Awareness | Brand awareness | Broad ICP |
| Engagement | Content promotion | Interested ICP |
| Conversion | Lead gen / Website | Engaged + qualified |

### Audience Building

**Native targeting**:
- Job title / function
- Company size
- Industry
- Seniority

**Custom audiences**:
- Website visitors (Insight Tag)
- Email list matches
- Engagement retargeting
- Lookalikes

## Signal-Based Retargeting

### The Ecosystem Enhancer Strategy

**Core insight**: LinkedIn can see ALL your website traffic and layer ICP filters on top. Use it to qualify and convert traffic from Google, organic, etc.

### Framework

```
1. CAPTURE: Website visitor audiences (30/60/90/180 day)
2. QUALIFY: Layer LinkedIn ICP filters (size, seniority, industry)
3. NURTURE: 90-day trust content to qualified visitors
4. CONVERT: BoFU campaigns to engaged subset
```

### Audience Windows

| Window | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| 30 day | Hot - recent visitors, conversion focus |
| 60 day | Warm - nurture and build |
| 90 day | Standard nurture pool |
| 180 day | Extended awareness |

### Nurture Content Rotation

Over 90 days, serve:
- Thought leader content (credibility)
- Case studies (proof)
- Educational assets (value)
- Demo clips (consideration)

**Not**: Constant demo CTAs to cold audiences.

### Engagement Triggers

When someone:
- Clicks MoFU content
- Watches 75%+ of video
- Downloads asset
- Visits pricing page

→ Move to 30-day BoFU campaign with stronger CTAs.

## Cross-Channel Synergy

### LinkedIn + Google Ads

LinkedIn retargeting on Google traffic:
- Google drives in-market searches
- LinkedIn qualifies to ICP
- LinkedIn nurtures buying committee
- Result: Higher conversion on Google spend

**Math example**:
- Google only: 2% conversion
- Google + LinkedIn retargeting: 4-6% on warmed traffic
- Incremental LinkedIn return: 10-30x

### LinkedIn + ABM

Use LinkedIn as primary warmup channel for ABM:
- Organic engagement with target accounts
- Paid content to account list
- Direct outreach to warmed contacts

## Measurement

### Organic Metrics

- Impressions and reach
- Engagement rate (>2% good, >5% great)
- Profile views
- Connection requests received
- DM conversations started

### Paid Metrics

| Metric | Awareness | Engagement | Conversion |
|--------|-----------|------------|------------|
| Focus | CPM, Reach | CTR, Engagement | CPL, ROAS |
| Target | <$30 CPM | >0.5% CTR | <$100 CPL |

### Cross-Channel Attribution

Track:
- Google CPL trend (should improve with LinkedIn retargeting)
- LinkedIn-influenced pipeline in CRM
- Account coverage and impressions via Company Hub

## B2B Tech Context

- Decision-makers ARE on LinkedIn
- Technical content performs well
- Industry-specific insights beat generic
- Video and carousels currently favored by algorithm

- Trust calibration → `trust-building-principles`
- ABM coordination → `running-abm-programs`
