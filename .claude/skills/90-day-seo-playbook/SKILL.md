# 90-Day SEO Playbook

**Depends on**: `seo-and-content-strategy`, `programmatic-seo`

## Core Insight

**SEO isn't a project. It's a system. But systems need kickstart momentum. 90 days of focused execution beats 2 years of scattered efforts.**

The AI disruption means traditional 12-18 month SEO timelines are obsolete. LLMs accelerate content. Google accelerates indexing. Markets accelerate competition.

## The New SEO Reality

| Old World | New World |
|-----------|-----------|
| 12-18 months for results | 90 days for meaningful traction |
| 4 blog posts per month | 20-40 pieces per month (AI-assisted) |
| Hope Google notices you | Structure for AI + Google |
| Content then links | Content + links + AI optimization simultaneously |
