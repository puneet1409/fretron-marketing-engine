# Trust Building Principles

## Core Insight

**The ask must match the trust level you've established.**

Demo request at zero trust = low conversion + brand damage.
Demo request at high trust = natural next step.

## The Trust Ladder

| Level | State | Their Mindset | Appropriate Ask |
|-------|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| 0 | Unknown | "Who is this?" | Nothing. Give value only. |
| 1 | Aware | "I've seen them around" | Follow, subscribe, read more |
| 2 | Interested | "They seem to know my world" | Download, calculator, light resource |
| 3 | Engaged | "They've helped me already" | 10-min conversation, quick audit |
| 4 | Trusting | "I'd take their call" | Demo, consultation, proposal |
| 5 | Advocating | "I'd recommend them" | Referral, case study, expansion |

## How Trust Builds

**Value** → Give before asking. Every interaction should leave them better off.

**Relevance** → Show you understand their specific world, not generic "companies like yours."

**Credibility** → Prove capability through content, social proof, specific results.

**Consistency** → Repeated helpful interactions compound. One touch ≠ trust.

## Trust Destroyers

- **Mismatched asks**: Demo CTA to cold traffic
- **Broken promises**: "I'll send that" → never sends
- **Self-focus**: Talking about your product before their problem
- **Generic outreach**: "Companies in your industry" without specificity
- **Desperate signals**: "Just checking in," "Circling back," begging for engagement

## Diagnosis Framework

When conversion is low:

1. **What trust level does this audience actually have?**
   - Cold list = Level 0
   - Content downloader = Level 2
   - Webinar attendee = Level 2-3
   - Demo requester = Level 4

2. **What are we asking for?**
   - Map ask to required trust level

3. **Is there a mismatch?**
   - If ask > trust, reduce the ask or increase trust first

## B2B Tech Specifics

**Cold outreach reality**: Email 1 is not first contact. For key accounts, it should come AFTER 2-4 weeks of ambient warmup (LinkedIn engagement, content exposure).

**Trust transfer**: Referrals and introductions transfer trust. A warm intro starts at Level 2-3, not Level 0.

**Committee dynamics**: Different stakeholders have different trust levels. Champion at Level 4 doesn't mean CFO is.

## Integration

This is the foundational skill. All other skills should check:
- What trust level am I assuming?
- Is my ask appropriate for that level?

Explicitly reference when using:
- `writing-b2b-emails` - calibrate ask per email
- `running-abm-programs` - phase warmup correctly
- `enabling-champions` - assess champion trust
- Any skill involving CTAs
