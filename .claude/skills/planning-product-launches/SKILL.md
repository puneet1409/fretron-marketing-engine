# Planning Product Launches

**Depends on**: `trust-building-principles`

## Core Insight

**Launches accelerate trust across many prospects simultaneously. Match launch messaging to prospect trust levels.**

Don't ask for demos from people who just heard of you.

## Launch Types

| Type | Audience | Goal |
|------|----------|------|
| Feature | Existing + pipeline | Retention, deal acceleration |
| Product | Existing + new segments | Revenue growth |
| Market Entry | New segment | Awareness, initial pipeline |
| Moment (funding, etc.) | Industry, media | Credibility, talent |

## Launch Planning Framework

### Phase 1: Strategy (4-6 weeks before)

Define:
- **Audience**: Primary, secondary, tertiary
- **Key messages**: 3 benefits max
- **Success metrics**: Awareness, engagement, pipeline
- **Timeline**: Soft launch, hard launch, sustain

### Phase 2: Content Creation (3-4 weeks before)

Core content (create first):
- Press release / blog post
- Product page update

Derivative content:
- Email versions (customer, prospect, partner)
- Social posts (10+ variations)
- Sales materials (deck, one-pager)

### Phase 3: Channel Coordination (2 weeks before)

| Channel | Content | Day |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Website | Update | 0 |
| Email - Customers | Announcement | 0 |
| Email - Prospects | Announcement | 0 |
| LinkedIn | Blog + exec posts | 0-1 |
| Sales | Internal brief | -1 |
| Ads | Campaign launch | 0-14 |

### Phase 4: Sales Enablement (1 week before)

- Talking points: 3 key messages
- FAQ: Anticipated questions
- Demo script update

### Phase 5: Execute (Day 0)

Simultaneous push:
- Publish website
- Send emails
- Post social
- Alert sales
- Monitor engagement

### Phase 6: Sustain (Week 1-4)

- Daily social engagement (Week 1)
- Retargeting ads
- Follow-up to engaged non-converters

## Launch Checklist

**Pre-launch:**
- [ ] All content approved and staged
- [ ] Team briefed
- [ ] Monitoring set up

**Launch day:**
- [ ] Website live
- [ ] Emails sent
- [ ] Social posted
- [ ] Metrics tracked

## Common Mistakes

1. Sales learns from social media (no internal alignment)
2. Same message all channels (no personalization)
3. One day wonder (no sustain plan)
4. Feature announcement vs benefit story
5. Demo CTA to cold audiences

## Integration

- Copy → `writing-persuasive-copy`
- Multi-format → `atomizing-content`
- Social execution → `linkedin-organic-and-paid`
- Trust-matched CTAs → `trust-building-principles`
