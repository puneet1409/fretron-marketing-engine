# Cluster ABM

**Depends on**: `defining-icp-and-tiers`, `selecting-and-researching-accounts`

## Core Insight

**Accounts that fit your ICP ≠ buying intent. Segment accounts by awareness and readiness, then run differentiated programs for each cluster.**

Don't waste SDR time and ad budget pitching to accounts that don't know you exist.

## The Three Account Clusters (Full Funnel)

### 1. Cluster ICP

**Definition**: Accounts that fit your ICP but:
- Are NOT vendor aware (don't know you exist)
- Have NO clear evidence they have a challenge your product solves

**Opportunity Likelihood**: <5%

**Goal**: Make them vendor aware, get initial engagement from buying committee members.

**Program**: Demand generation - awareness campaigns, thought leadership, industry content.

### 2. Future Pipeline

**Definition**: Accounts that are:
- Vendor aware (some engagement, but no buying intent)
- Need is NOT validated (you don't know if they have a challenge you solve)

**Opportunity Likelihood**: <30%

**Goal**: Collect information about account needs, build relationship with potential Champions, validate if they have a prioritized challenge.

**Program**: Nurture with segment content, connect/engage/profile buying committee, relationship building.

### 3. Active Focus

**Definition**: Accounts with:
- Strong engagement demonstrated
- Relationship with buying committee members
- Strong product need evidence

**Opportunity Likelihood**: High

**Goal**: Opportunity development, Champion creation, deal acceleration.

**Program**: 80% of sales and marketing activities should focus here.

## Resource Allocation

```
Cluster ICP     → Demand Gen Program (automated, scaled)
Future Pipeline → 20% of sales/marketing activities
Active Focus    → 80% of sales/marketing activities
```

**Key Principle**: Don't spend premium SDR time on Cluster ICP. Use content and ads to move them to Future Pipeline first.

## Cluster Definition Process

### Step 1: Segment Existing Target List

For each account, assess:

| Question | Yes → | No → |
|----------|-------|------|
| Have they engaged with us? (website, content, event) | Future Pipeline or Active Focus | Cluster ICP |
| Is there evidence of a challenge we solve? | Future Pipeline or Active Focus | Cluster ICP |
| Have we validated need with buying committee? | Active Focus | Future Pipeline |
| Are there strong buying signals? | Active Focus | Future Pipeline |

### Step 2: Apply Engagement Threshold

Define engagement threshold based on:
- Social repetitive engagement
- Website intent signals
- Event sign-ups
- Content downloads
- Email engagement

**Accounts above threshold**: Move from Cluster ICP → Future Pipeline

### Step 3: Assign Programs

| Cluster | Size | Program Type | Owner |
|---------|------|--------------|-------|
| Cluster ICP | Large (100-500+) | Automated demand gen | Marketing |
| Future Pipeline | Medium (50-100) | SDR + Marketing nurture | Shared |
| Active Focus | Small (10-30) | High-touch ABM | Sales + Marketing |
