# Cluster ABM

**Depends on**: `defining-icp-and-tiers`, `selecting-and-researching-accounts`

## Core Insight

**ICP fit ≠ buying intent. Segment by awareness and readiness, then run differentiated programs. Don't waste SDR time on accounts that don't know you exist.**

## The Three Clusters

| Cluster | Definition | Opportunity | Program |
|---------|------------|-------------|---------|
| **Cluster ICP** | Fit ICP but not vendor-aware, no evidence of challenge | <5% | Automated demand gen (marketing) |
| **Future Pipeline** | Vendor-aware but need not validated | <30% | SDR + Marketing nurture (shared) |
| **Active Focus** | Strong engagement, validated need, buying committee engaged | High | 80% of sales/marketing activities |

## Resource Allocation

```
Cluster ICP     → 100-500 accounts → Automated demand gen
Future Pipeline → 50-100 accounts  → 20% of resources
Active Focus    → 10-30 accounts   → 80% of resources
```

**Key principle**: Content and ads move Cluster ICP to Future Pipeline. SDR time is reserved for Future Pipeline and Active Focus.

## Cluster Segmentation Questions

For each account, assess:

| Question | Yes → | No → |
|----------|-------|------|
| Engaged with us? (website, content, event) | Future Pipeline+ | Cluster ICP |
| Evidence of challenge we solve? | Future Pipeline+ | Cluster ICP |
| Validated need with buying committee? | Active Focus | Future Pipeline |
| Strong buying signals? | Active Focus | Future Pipeline |

## Programs by Cluster

### Cluster ICP Program
**Goal**: Move from "Never heard of you" to "Vendor aware"

- Industry thought leadership (not product-focused)
- LinkedIn ads to job titles at cluster accounts
- Educational webinars
- Useful resources (benchmarks, guides)

**Metrics**: Accounts moving to Future Pipeline, website visits from cluster.

### Future Pipeline Program
**Goal**: Validate challenges and build buying committee relationships

- SDR meaningful engagement (LinkedIn commenting, personalized connects)
- Segment-specific content sequences
- Market research interviews
- Peer roundtables

**Questions to answer**: Does account have challenge we solve? Have they prioritized it? Who's the buying committee?

### Active Focus Program
**Goal**: Create champions and generate opportunities

- 1-to-1 executive briefings
- Personalized business cases
- Multi-thread across buying committee
- Champion development

**Metrics**: Opportunities created, pipeline value, win rate.

## Micro-Segmentation

Within Future Pipeline, group by:

- **Challenge**: Cost reduction vs growth vs risk vs digital transformation
- **Vertical**: Similar industry contexts for relevant examples
- **Stage**: Growth (scaling) vs Established (optimizing) vs Transformation

Create segment-specific content and messaging for each.

## Cluster Movement Triggers

### Promotion: Cluster ICP → Future Pipeline
- Content engagement (download, webinar)
- Website visit to intent pages
- LinkedIn connection accepted
- Responded to outreach

### Promotion: Future Pipeline → Active Focus
- Challenge validated through conversation
- Multiple buying committee members engaged
- Expressed timeline or budget

### Demotion Triggers
- Deal stalled, champion left, budget cycle missed → Active Focus → Future Pipeline
- No engagement after 6 months, confirmed no priority → Future Pipeline → Cluster ICP

## Integration

- For ICP definition → `defining-icp-and-tiers`
- For account selection → `selecting-and-researching-accounts`
- For warmup tactics → `warming-up-accounts`
- For events → `running-abm-events`
