# Generating Demand

**Depends on**: `trust-building-principles`

## Core Insight

**Buyers spend 95% of their time NOT buying. Align your activities with their current demand level - don't pitch solutions to people who just want to learn, and don't educate people who are ready to buy.**

## Three Levels of Demand

| Level | Buyer State | Your Goal |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| **Demand for Content** | "I want to learn" - no buying intent, living with challenges | Capture attention, associate brand with topics they care about |
| **Demand for Solution** | "I need to solve this" - problem prioritized, searching | Get into consideration set, educate on your approach |
| **Demand for Vendor** | "I'm evaluating options" - comparing vendors | Win the deal, reduce risk perception |

### Level 1: Demand for Content

**Trigger**: None. They're just doing their job.

**What they want**: Industry insights, best practices, peer perspectives, trends.

**Content types**: Thought leadership, podcasts, newsletters, educational events, community engagement.

**Your goal**: Be discovered BEFORE they have a problem. When a trigger hits, they'll remember you.

**Key question**: Where do our ICP personas go to learn? How can we show up there with valuable perspectives?

### Level 2: Demand for Solution

**Trigger**: Business event shifted priorities (missed targets, board mandate, competitive pressure, leadership change).

**What they want**: How others solved this problem, frameworks for evaluation, approach validation.

**Content types**: Case studies, before/after stories, solution frameworks, implementation guides.

**Your goal**: Influence their purchase criteria. Show why YOUR approach matters.

**Key question**: What are the challenges our solution solves? How do we show the before/after transformation?

### Level 3: Demand for Vendor

**Trigger**: They've decided on solution type, now comparing vendors.

**What they want**: Product proof, risk reduction, implementation clarity, ROI validation.

**Content types**: Demos, trials, pricing, reviews, comparison guides, implementation plans.

**Your goal**: Differentiate from competitors, reduce perceived risk, accelerate decision.

**Key question**: What questions does each buying committee member need answered? What proof reduces their risk?

## Demand Capture

### Intent Signals to Watch

**First-party (your data)**:
- Pricing page visits, demo requests
- Repeated visits to solution pages
- Webinar attendance on product topics
- Content hub engagement depth

**Second-party (partner data)**:
- G2/Capterra profile views
- Review site comparisons

**Third-party (bought signals)**:
- Competitor keyword searches
- Job postings indicating need
- Tech stack changes

### Capture Approaches

| Signal Strength | Approach |
|-----------------|----------|
| High (demo request, pricing visit) | Immediate sales outreach |
| Medium (multiple solution page visits) | Personalized content + soft outreach |
| Low (single engagement) | Retargeting, nurture sequence |

## Program Design Questions

When designing demand gen programs, ask:

1. **Which demand level am I targeting?** Don't mix levels in one program.
2. **What content exists for this level?** Map gaps.
3. **How will we distribute?** Organic, paid, 1-to-1, partnerships?
4. **What signals will we capture?** How will we know it's working?
5. **What's the handoff to next level?** Content → Solution → Vendor transitions.
