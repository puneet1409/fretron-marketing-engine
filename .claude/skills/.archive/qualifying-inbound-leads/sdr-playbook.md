### Opening Script

```
"Hi [Name], thanks for taking the time. Before we dive in,
let me tell you how I'd like to use our 15 minutes:

I'll ask a few questions to understand your situation, then
based on that, I can tell you honestly if Fretron would be
a fit or not. If it is, we'll schedule a demo with someone
who can really show you the product. Sound good?

Great. To start—can you give me a quick overview of how
you handle logistics today?"
```

### Situation Questions

```
VOLUME & SCALE:
"Approximately how many shipments do you handle per day?"
"How many plants or dispatch points do you have?"
"What's your rough annual freight spend?"

CURRENT STATE:
"How do you track shipments today? Excel, a system, phone calls?"
"Who's responsible for logistics tracking on your team?"
"What systems do you use for ERP—SAP, Oracle, Tally?"

ORGANIZATION:
"Who else is involved in logistics decisions at [Company]?"
"Does this report up through operations, finance, or...?"
```

### Problem Questions

```
PAIN EXPLORATION:
"What's the biggest headache in your logistics operations right now?"
"If I talked to your dispatch team, what would they complain about?"
"What happens when a shipment is delayed—how do you find out?"

SPECIFIC PROBING:
"How many tracking calls does your team make in a typical day?"
"How long does freight invoice reconciliation take you?"
"What's your OTIF right now, roughly?"

IMPACT QUESTIONS:
"When visibility is lacking, what's the impact on customers?"
"Have you ever lost business or faced penalties due to delivery issues?"
"What does that tracking and reconciliation time cost you in labor?"
```

### Timeline & Urgency Questions

```
TRIGGER:
"What's driving the interest in solving this now?"
"Has something changed recently that made this a priority?"
"What happens if you don't solve this in the next 6 months?"

TIMELINE:
"If you found the right solution, when would you want to be live?"
"Is there a budget cycle or deadline we should know about?"
"Have you looked at solutions before? What happened?"

BUYING PROCESS:
"Besides yourself, who else would be involved in evaluating this?"
"What's the typical process for approving something like this at [Company]?"
"Is there a budget allocated for this, or would that need to be built?"
```

### Qualification Assessment

**BANT+T Scoring**:

| Criteria | Question | Score |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Budget | "Is there budget for this?" | Approved=3, Planned=2, Unknown=1 |
| Authority | "Are you the decision maker?" | Decision maker=3, Influencer=2, Researcher=1 |
| Need | "How urgent is this?" | Urgent pain=3, Acknowledged=2, Exploring=1 |
| Timeline | "When do you want to decide?" | 0-3mo=3, 3-6mo=2, 6-12mo=1 |
| Trigger | "What's driving this now?" | Clear event=3, Planned change=2, None=1 |

**Score Interpretation**:
- 13-15: Hot lead → Immediate AE handoff
- 10-12: Warm lead → Schedule demo, nurture
- 7-9: Cool lead → Nurture sequence
- <7: Not qualified → Politely DQ

## Closing for Next Steps

### If Qualified

```
"Based on what you've shared, I think Fretron could really help
with [specific pain]. Here's what I suggest:

Let me connect you with [AE Name], one of our logistics experts.
They can show you exactly how we've solved [pain] for companies
like [similar customer].

Do you have 45 minutes on [Day] at [Time] or [Alternative]?

[Book meeting]

Great. I'll send a calendar invite and copy [AE Name]. They
might reach out beforehand to prepare. Any questions before then?"
```

### If Not Qualified (Timing)

```
"It sounds like the timing isn't quite right—and that's okay.
I don't want to waste your time if this isn't a priority yet.

Here's what I suggest: Let me send you some resources that might
be useful when you're ready. And I'll check back in [timeframe]
to see if anything's changed.

Does that work?"
```

### If Not Qualified (Fit)

```
"Based on what you've shared, I'm not sure Fretron is the right
fit for [reason]. We're really built for [ICP description].

That said, [alternative suggestion if applicable].

I appreciate your time, and if your situation changes, don't
hesitate to reach out."
```

## Outbound Prospecting

### Cold Call Script

```
OPENING (Get Permission):
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from Fretron. Did I catch you
at a bad time?

[If yes - bad time]
When's better? I'll call back then.

[If skeptical/who?]
We help manufacturing companies like [Company] get visibility
into their logistics. Is that something you deal with?

[If no - good time]
Great. I'll be brief..."

REASON FOR CALL:
"I'm calling because I noticed [Company] is [trigger/reason].
Usually when that happens, logistics visibility becomes a bigger
challenge. Is that something you're seeing?

[Listen]

VALUE STATEMENT:
"The reason I bring it up—we've helped companies like [reference]
reduce their tracking calls by 85% and cut freight costs 15-25%.

I'm not sure if that's relevant for you, but I thought it was
worth a quick conversation."

ASK:
"Would you be open to a 15-minute call to see if there's a fit?
I promise to be upfront if I don't think we can help.

[If yes] Great, how's [Day] at [Time]?
[If no/pushback] Handle objection..."
```

### Cold Call Objection Handling

**"I'm not interested"**
```
"I totally get it—unexpected calls are never convenient. Can I
ask: is logistics visibility something you deal with at all, or
does someone else handle that?"

[If someone else] "Who would that be? Happy to reach out to them instead."
[If they do] "Got it. Is it because things are working well, or
just not a priority right now?"
```

**"We already have something"**
```
"That's great—can I ask what you're using?

[Listen]

Makes sense. Just curious: are you getting real-time visibility
across all shipments, or is there still some manual tracking?

The reason I ask—most companies we talk to have something, but
still make hundreds of tracking calls. Is that your situation?"
```

**"Send me an email"**
```
"Happy to. So I send something relevant, what's the biggest
challenge in your logistics right now—visibility, costs, or
something else?

[Listen]

Got it. I'll send that over. And if it resonates, would you be
open to a brief call to discuss?"
```

**"Now's not a good time"**
```
"Totally understand. When would be better—later this week or
next week?

[Get specific time]

Great, I'll call then. Just so I'm prepared, what would be most
useful to discuss?"
```

### Voicemail Script

```
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from Fretron.

I noticed [Company] is [trigger/observation], and I wanted to
share how [similar company] handled a similar situation—they
reduced tracking calls by 85%.

I'll try you again [day/time], or feel free to reach me at
[phone number].

Again, [Your Name] from Fretron, [phone number]."
```

**Voicemail Rules**:
- Keep under 30 seconds
- Leave max 2 voicemails per prospect
- Always follow with email
- Vary the message each time

### Email Follow-Up After Voicemail

```
SUBJECT: Tried calling + [Company] logistics

Just left you a voicemail. Quick context:

companies [in their situation], logistics visibility usually
becomes a bigger challenge.

We helped [similar company] handle this—they reduced tracking
calls by 85% and cut freight costs 18%.

Worth a 15-minute call to see if relevant for [Company]?
