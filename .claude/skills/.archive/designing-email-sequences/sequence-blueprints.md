P.S. I'll share a related case study in a few days that
puts this into practice.
```

### Email 2: Expand the Topic (Day 3)

**Subject**: The hidden cost most [roles] miss

```
Hi [Name],

Hope you found the [Asset Name] useful.

There's one thing we didn't cover in depth that I wanted
to expand on:

[Specific insight or topic that extends the asset]

Here's why this matters:

Most [industry] companies focus on [obvious thing], but
the real leakage is in [less obvious thing].

For example:
→ [Specific example with numbers]
→ [Another example]

Something to think about as you apply the framework.

Best,
[Signature]
```

### Email 3: Case Study (Day 7)

**Subject**: How [Similar Company] applied this

```
Hi [Name],

Theory is great. Results are better.

Here's how [Similar Company] put the [Asset Topic] into practice:

**Their Situation**:
[1-2 sentences about their before state - relatable to recipient]

**What They Did**:
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]

**The Results (90 days)**:

### Email 4: Qualification Question (Day 10)

**Subject**: Quick question for you

```
Hi [Name],

I'm curious—after going through the [Asset Name],
where does [Company] stand on this spectrum?

A) "We've got this covered"
B) "It's on our radar, but not urgent"
C) "This is a real problem we need to solve"
D) "Didn't realize this was an issue until now"

Just reply with the letter. Helps me know if there's
anything else I can share that would be useful.

(No wrong answer—I'm just trying to be helpful, not pushy.)

Best,
[Signature]
```

### Email 5: Soft Demo Offer (Day 14)

```
Hi [Name],

Want to see how it actually works in practice?

I can show you in 20 minutes:

• What the day-to-day looks like
• Where you'd likely see the biggest wins

No pressure, no hard sell. If it's not relevant, I'll
tell you honestly.

Interested? Grab a time here: [Calendar Link]

Or just reply with a time that works for you.

Best,
[Signature]

P.S. If the timing isn't right, no worries. I'll just
add you to our monthly insights email—useful stuff,
no sales pitch.

## Blueprint 3: Event Follow-Up Sequence

**Trigger**: Met at conference/webinar/event
**Goal**: Convert event connection to opportunity
**Duration**: 14 days, 4 emails

### Email 1: Personal Follow-Up (Day 1)

**Subject**: Great meeting you at [Event]

```
Hi [Name],

Really enjoyed our conversation at [Event] yesterday.

Your point about [specific thing they said] stuck with
me—it's exactly what we're hearing from other [industry]
companies.

As promised, here's [thing you promised to send]:
[Link]

Would love to continue the conversation. Would a quick
call next week make sense?

Best,
[Signature]

P.S. [Personal note about something non-business you
discussed]
```

### Email 2: Relevant Content (Day 4)

**Subject**: Thought of you when I saw this

```
Hi [Name],

This case study reminded me of what you mentioned about
[their challenge] at [Event]:

[Brief summary and link]

The parallels:
• [Similarity 1]
• [Similarity 2]

Might give you some ideas—even if Fretron isn't the
right fit.

Best,
[Signature]
```

### Email 3: Specific Value (Day 8)

**Subject**: Quick sizing for [Company]

```
Hi [Name],

Based on what you shared at [Event], I did some rough
math on [Company]'s opportunity:

If you're like similar [industry] companies:
• [Metric 1]: [Range]
• [Metric 2]: [Range]
• [Metric 3]: [Range]

Estimated annual value: ₹[X-Y]L

I could be off—would need to see your actual data.
But directionally, this is what we typically see.

Worth 15 minutes to pressure-test these assumptions?

Best,
[Signature]
```

### Email 4: Final Check-In (Day 14)

**Subject**: Still relevant?

```
Hi [Name],

I've sent a few notes since we met at [Event].
Haven't heard back, which usually means one of:

• Timing is off (fair)
• Not a priority right now (also fair)
• My emails went to spam (less fair but happens)

I don't want to keep pinging if it's not useful.

Quick reply to let me know?
• "Yes, let's talk" → I'll send times
• "Not now" → I'll check back in 3 months
• "Stop emailing" → Done, no hard feelings

Best,
[Signature]
```

Want to make sure your demo request didn't fall
through the cracks.

I've got openings this week:
• [Day 1] at [Time 1] or [Time 2]
• [Day 2] at [Time 1] or [Time 2]

15-20 minutes—I'll ask a few questions about your
needs, show you the relevant parts of Fretron, and
you can decide if it's worth exploring further.

Which works?

Best,
[Signature]
```

### Email 4: Last Attempt (Day 7)

**Subject**: Should I close this out?

```
Hi [Name],

I've reached out a few times about your demo request.
No response—which happens.

out for now.

any of my emails. The door's always open.

Best,

## Blueprint 5: Re-Engagement Sequence

**Trigger**: Lead went cold after previous engagement
**Goal**: Rekindle interest, find new timing
**Duration**: 21 days, 3 emails

### Email 1: The Check-In (Day 0)

**Subject**: Quick check-in from [X] months ago

```
Hi [Name],

We connected [X months] ago about [topic]. You mentioned
[specific thing they said], but the timing wasn't right.

Curious if anything has changed?

A few things have happened since we last spoke:
• [New feature relevant to their interest]
• [New customer win in their industry]
• [New insight or benchmark]

If the timing is better now, I'd love to reconnect.

### Email 2: Trigger-Based Value (Day 7)

**Subject**: Noticed [trigger event] at [Company]

```
Hi [Name],

Saw the news about [trigger event—expansion, new hire,
funding, etc.] at [Company]. Congratulations!

Given [the trigger], I imagine [likely challenge or
opportunity] is top of mind.

When we talked before, you mentioned [their challenge].
This kind of [trigger] usually accelerates that need.

Would a quick call to revisit be useful?

Best,
[Signature]
```

### Email 3: The Door Open (Day 21)

**Subject**: No pressure, just leaving the door open

```
Hi [Name],

I've pinged you a couple times—not trying to be
annoying, just making sure you know the door is open.

If logistics visibility ever becomes a priority for
[Company], here's what I'd suggest:

1. Let me know → I'll send relevant info
2. Quick call → 15 min to see if there's fit
3. Full audit → We analyze your data, you decide

No rush. I'll stop following up for now, but feel
free to reply anytime if something changes.

Best,
[Signature]
