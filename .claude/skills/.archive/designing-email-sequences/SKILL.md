Create powerful email drip campaigns that nurture leads and drive conversations.

## When to Use This Skill

- Creating post-download nurture flows
- Designing demo/meeting follow-up sequences
- Planning re-engagement campaigns
- Writing individual emails in a sequence

## Email Sequence Types

### 1. Cold Outreach Sequence (5-7 emails over 3 weeks)
**Goal**: Book a discovery call with cold prospects

### 2. Lead Magnet Nurture (4-6 emails over 2 weeks)
**Goal**: Move from download to demo request

### 3. Demo Follow-Up (3-4 emails over 1 week)
**Goal**: Move from demo to pilot/proposal

### 4. Re-Engagement (3 emails over 2 weeks)
**Goal**: Revive cold leads

## Cold Outreach Sequence Template

### Email 1: The Hook (Day 0)
**Subject**: Quick question about [their company]'s freight

```
Hi [Name],

Noticed [Company] ships [category/volume indicator]. Quick question:

Are you tracking cost-per-MT-km across lanes, or still pulling it manually from invoices?

Most mid-market shippers we talk to lose 8-15% to hidden costs they can't see in Excel.

Worth a 15-min look at your top lanes?

```

### Email 2: The Proof (Day 3)
**Subject**: How [Similar Company] found ₹18L in savings

```
Hi [Name],

Following up - thought this might interest you.

A [industry] shipper similar to you (100+ loads/day) ran our Dispatch Value Audit. Found:
- ₹18L/year in consolidation opportunities
- 4-point OTIF improvement potential
- 3 "quick win" levers ready to pull

Took 30 minutes + some lane data. No commitment.

Open to seeing what's hiding in your dispatch data?

[Signature]
```

### Email 3: The Pain (Day 7)
**Subject**: The WhatsApp problem

```
Hi [Name],

Every dispatch team I meet has the same story:

15 Excel sheets. 30 WhatsApp groups. Zero visibility until something breaks.

We built Fretron for exactly this - one screen to see, decide, and dispatch.

Go live in 6 weeks, not 6 months.

Worth a quick call to see if it fits?

```

### Email 4: The Value (Day 10)
**Subject**: What 6 weeks could look like

```
Hi [Name],

Imagine in 6 weeks:
- Every truck on one screen
- Cost-per-lane visibility without manual pulling
- Spot buying that's competitive, not chaotic

That's what a Fretron pilot looks like.

Most mid-market shippers start with 5-10 lanes, see 8-15% savings, then expand.

15 minutes to see if it makes sense for [Company]?

```

### Email 5: The Breakup (Day 14)
**Subject**: Should I close your file?

```
Hi [Name],

I've reached out a few times about freight visibility and cost savings.

I'll assume the timing isn't right - totally understand.

If things change and you want to explore reducing freight costs or fixing dispatch chaos, just reply.

Otherwise, I'll stop reaching out.

Thanks for your time,

## Lead Magnet Nurture Sequence

### Email 1: Delivery (Immediate)
**Subject**: Your [Lead Magnet Name] is ready

```
Hi [Name],

Here's the [Lead Magnet] you requested: [Link]

Quick tip: Start with [specific first step] - most people find that's where the biggest insight hides.

Let me know if you have questions.

[Signature]

P.S. If you want a personalized analysis of your lanes, reply "audit" and I'll send details.
```

### Email 2: Engagement Check (Day 2)
**Subject**: Did you find your number?

```
Hi [Name],

Curious - did you get a chance to run through the [Lead Magnet]?

Most users find [specific insight] surprising.

If you got stuck or have questions, just reply.

[Signature]
```

### Email 3: Case Study (Day 5)
**Subject**: What [Similar Company] did after this

```
Hi [Name],

After running a similar analysis, [Similar Company] in [industry] discovered:
- [Specific finding]
- [Specific result]

They started with a Dispatch Value Audit on 5 lanes. 30 days later, saw [outcome].

Want me to walk through what that could look like for [Company]?

[Signature]
```

### Email 4: Direct Offer (Day 8)
**Subject**: Ready to go deeper?

```
Hi [Name],

You've seen the [Lead Magnet]. Now the question:

What would it mean to actually capture those savings?

Our Dispatch Value Audit takes 30 minutes + your lane data. We deliver:
- Your actual numbers (not estimates)
- Top 3 levers you can pull
- A pilot proposal if you want to move forward

No pressure, no commitment. Just clarity.

Reply "audit" if interested.

Happy to do a quick recap call with them if helpful.

[Signature]
```

### Email 3: Day 5-7 Nudge

```

Does this still make sense? Any blockers I can help with?

## Email Writing Rules

### Subject Lines
- Keep under 40 characters
- Personalize when possible
- Use lowercase (feels personal)
- Create curiosity or state value

**Good**: "quick question about freight"
**Bad**: "Fretron TMS - Transform Your Supply Chain Today!"

### Body Copy
- Short paragraphs (1-2 sentences)
- One idea per email
- Write at 6th grade reading level
- Use "you" more than "we"
- End with clear CTA or question

### CTAs
- One CTA per email
- Make it easy (reply vs. schedule vs. click)
- Be specific: "Reply 'audit'" beats "Let me know"

### Timing
- Send Tuesday-Thursday mornings (India: 10am-12pm)
- Avoid Mondays (inbox overload) and Fridays (weekend mode)
- B2B: Business hours only

## Sequence Performance Benchmarks

## Personalization Tokens

Always personalize:

Research-based personalization (when possible):

- Job change / new role
- Specific pain indicators from LinkedIn/website

## Testing & Optimization

Test one variable at a time:
1. Subject lines (biggest impact)
2. Send time
3. CTA format
4. Email length
5. Proof/social proof inclusion

Track:
- Open rates by subject line
- Reply rates by email
