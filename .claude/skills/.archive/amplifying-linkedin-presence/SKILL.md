## Full Funnel ABM on LinkedIn

From Full Funnel methodology: LinkedIn is the primary channel for B2B ABM.

### The Full Funnel LinkedIn Approach

**Key Stats:**
- 2/3 of Full Funnel's clients discover them via LinkedIn
- 11-12 million impressions/year from consistent posting
- 95% of clients from inbound (driven by LinkedIn thought leadership)

### Content Approach (Fletch PMM Style)

**What Makes Content Work:**
- Practical and immediately applicable (frameworks they can use today)
- Distinctive visual style (recognizable in feed)
- Polarizing/opinionated (drives engagement)
- Generous with frameworks (free value builds trust)

**Content Pillars:**
1. **Framework Shares**: Visual frameworks and canvases
2. **Myth Busting**: Contrarian takes on common practices
3. **Before/After Examples**: Show transformation
4. **Case Studies**: Real results (anonymized if needed)

### LinkedIn ABM Warmup Integration

**For Tier 1 Target Accounts:**
1. Follow 3-5 key contacts from each account
2. Engage authentically with their content (2-3 weeks)
3. Connection request with context
4. Value-first DM (no pitch)
5. Soft conversation ask (after engagement)

**Key Insight**: The goal is not to sell on LinkedIn. It's to build familiarity so when you reach out, they recognize you.
