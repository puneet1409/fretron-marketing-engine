## Template 1: Industry Insight

Best for: Thought leadership, positioning as expert

```
[Observation about the industry - provocative or surprising]

Here's what I'm seeing:

→ [Trend/observation 1]
→ [Trend/observation 2]
→ [Trend/observation 3]

The companies winning right now are [doing X differently].

[Optional: One sentence about what this means for the future]

What are you seeing in [industry/area]? ↓

#logistics #supplychain #manufacturing
```

**Example (Fretron)**:
```
Most logistics leaders I talk to are still making decisions
with data that's 2-3 days old.

Here's what I'm seeing:

→ Real-time visibility is table stakes (not competitive advantage)
→ The gap is in what you DO with that visibility
→ Exception-based management is the new efficiency frontier

The companies winning right now aren't tracking more—they're
tracking smarter.

What's your biggest visibility gap today? ↓

#logistics #supplychain #manufacturing

## Template 2: Customer Story

Best for: Social proof, credibility, specific results

```
A [industry] company came to us with a problem:

[Describe the problem in their words - make it relatable]

Here's what we found:
• [Finding/insight 1]
• [Finding/insight 2]
• [Finding/insight 3]

After [timeframe], they're seeing:
✓ [Result 1 with number]
✓ [Result 2 with number]

The lesson? [Key insight that applies broadly]

#logistics #manufacturing #supplychain
```

**Example (Fretron)**:
```
A steel manufacturer came to us with a problem:

"We're spending 40+ hours a week just calling drivers for
location updates. And customers still complain about visibility."

Here's what we found:
• 500+ tracking calls per day (yes, really)
• 3-4 hour delay between actual status and their records
• Customer escalations were eating into operations time

After 90 days with automated tracking, they're seeing:
✓ 85% reduction in tracking calls
✓ Real-time visibility for 100% of shipments
✓ Customer escalations down 60%

The lesson? Sometimes the biggest wins come from eliminating
work that shouldn't exist in the first place.

## Template 3: Contrarian Take

Best for: Engagement, differentiation, sparking discussion

```
Unpopular opinion:

[Contrarian statement that challenges common wisdom]

Here's why:

Most people think [common belief].

But the reality is [counter-argument with evidence].

The companies that understand this [positive outcome].

Agree? Disagree? Tell me why ↓

#logistics #supplychain
```

**Example (Fretron)**:
```
Unpopular opinion:

Your TMS implementation should NOT take 12 months.

Here's why:

Most people think enterprise software requires long
implementations. "It's complex. We need to be thorough."

But the reality is: complexity is often a choice, not
a requirement. We've seen TMS go-lives in 6-8 weeks—with
better adoption than 12-month projects.

The companies that understand this get to ROI faster,
while competitors are still "in implementation."

Agree? Disagree? Tell me why ↓

#logistics #TMS #supplychain
```

## Template 4: Tactical Framework

Best for: Providing value, positioning as helpful expert

```
Simple framework I use for [task/challenge]:

Step 1: [Action]
↳ [Why it matters or how to do it]

Step 2: [Action]
↳ [Why it matters or how to do it]

Step 3: [Action]
↳ [Why it matters or how to do it]

Result: [Outcome you can expect]

#logistics #supplychain #framework
```

**Example (Fretron)**:
```
Simple framework for evaluating a TMS (before demos):

Step 1: Map your actual workflow
↳ Don't let vendors tell you what you need—know your process

Step 2: Quantify your pain
↳ "We waste 40 hrs/week on tracking" beats "visibility is bad"

Step 3: Define success in your words
↳ Not feature lists—business outcomes you'll measure

Result: You'll ask better questions, get better demos,
and make decisions you won't regret.

## Template 5: Personal Reflection

Best for: Authenticity, building connection, lessons learned

```
[Time period] ago, I [situation/belief/action].

I thought [assumption you held].

I was wrong.

What I learned:
→ [Lesson 1]
→ [Lesson 2]
→ [Lesson 3]

Now I [new approach/belief].

The difference has been [outcome/impact].

#leadership #growth
```

**Example (Fretron)**:
```
3 years ago, I thought the best sales approach was to
demonstrate every feature our product had.

I thought: "More features = more value = easier sale."

I was wrong.

What I learned:
→ Customers don't buy features—they buy outcomes
→ A focused demo on THEIR problem beats a feature tour
→ Listening first, demoing second changes everything

Now I spend 60% of demo time on discovery.

The difference: Close rates went from 15% to 35%.

#sales #B2B #startups

## Template 6: Behind the Scenes

Best for: Humanizing the company, culture, authenticity

```
Something we don't talk about enough at [Company]:

[Honest admission or behind-the-scenes insight]

[Story or example that illustrates it]

Why share this?

Because [reason this matters to audience].

#startups #culture #building
```

**Example (Fretron)**:
```
Something we don't talk about enough at Fretron:

We've had implementations that didn't go smoothly.

Last quarter, one go-live took 3 weeks longer than promised.
We'd underestimated the ERP integration complexity.
It was frustrating—for the customer and for us.

What did we do?

We were transparent about the delay, added resources at
no extra cost, and did a full retrospective to prevent it
from happening again.

Why share this?

Because every vendor says "we're customer-first."
What matters is what happens when things go wrong.

#startups #customersuccess #B2B
```

## Template 7: Data/Stat Hook

Best for: Credibility, thought leadership, shareability

```
[Surprising statistic or data point]

Let that sink in.

What this means:
• [Implication 1]
• [Implication 2]
• [Implication 3]

[Your perspective or call to action]

Source: [Citation if available]

#logistics #data #supplychain
```

**Example (Fretron)**:
```
Indian manufacturing companies lose 3-5% of freight costs
to detention and demurrage annually.

Let that sink in.

For a company with ₹50 Cr freight spend, that's ₹1.5-2.5 Cr
just... gone.

What this means:
• It's not a rounding error—it's material
• Most of it is preventable with visibility
• The CFO probably doesn't know the real number

We see this data in almost every audit we run.

What's your detention cost running?

## Engagement Best Practices

### Good Comment Examples

**Adding Value**:
```
Great point about [specific thing]. We've seen similar -
[add your perspective or data]. One thing I'd add is
[additional insight that builds on their point].
```

**Asking a Question**:
```
Really interesting perspective. Curious - how did you
approach [specific aspect]? We've been experimenting
with [related approach] and seeing [result].
```

**Sharing Experience**:
```
This resonates. When we [did similar thing], the biggest
lesson was [lesson]. Did you find the same?
```

### Bad Comment Examples (Avoid)

```

```

These add no value and don't build relationships.
