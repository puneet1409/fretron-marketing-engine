# Direct Response Copywriting Frameworks

Proven formulas and templates for writing copy that converts.

## Core Direct Response Principles

### The 4 U's of Compelling Copy

Every headline and hook should aim for:

| U | Description | Example (Fretron) |
|---|-------------|-------------------|
| **Urgent** | Creates time pressure | "Your freight costs increase 3% every month you wait" |
| **Unique** | Different from alternatives | "The only TMS built for Indian manufacturing" |
| **Ultra-specific** | Concrete, not vague | "Reduce tracking calls from 500 to 50 per day" |
| **Useful** | Clear benefit | "See every shipment in real-time" |

### The 5 Levels of Awareness

Match copy sophistication to prospect awareness:

| Level | State | Copy Approach | Fretron Example |
|-------|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| 1. Unaware | Don't know they have problem | Lead with problem education | "The hidden cost draining your logistics budget" |
| 2. Problem-Aware | Know problem, not solutions | Agitate pain, hint at solution | "Still tracking shipments with phone calls?" |
| 3. Solution-Aware | Know solutions exist | Differentiate your solution | "Why mid-market manufacturers choose purpose-built TMS" |
| 4. Product-Aware | Know your product | Overcome objections, prove value | "See why 100+ companies switched from SAP TM" |
| 5. Most Aware | Ready to buy | Make the offer irresistible | "Start your 6-week implementation today" |

## Body Copy Frameworks

### PAS Framework (Problem-Agitate-Solve)

**Structure**:
```
PROBLEM: Identify the pain
↓
AGITATE: Make it worse (emotional impact)
↓
SOLVE: Present your solution
```

**Fretron Example**:
```
PROBLEM:
Your dispatch team spends 4+ hours daily on tracking calls.
That's not logistics management—it's phone operator work.

AGITATE:
Every hour on tracking calls is an hour not spent on
optimization. Meanwhile, your competitors are using that
time to negotiate better rates, reduce detention, and
improve customer service.

The longer this continues, the wider the gap becomes.

SOLVE:
Fretron gives you real-time visibility across all shipments.
No tracking calls needed. Your team sees exceptions before
they become problems—and has time to actually solve them.
```

---

### AIDA Framework (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action)

**Structure**:
```
ATTENTION: Hook them immediately
↓
INTEREST: Build engagement with relevant info
↓
DESIRE: Create want through benefits/proof
↓
ACTION: Clear call to action
```

**Fretron Example**:
```
ATTENTION:
500 tracking calls a day.
That was the reality at [Company] before they found a better way.

INTEREST:
Like most mid-market manufacturers, they'd outgrown Excel
but weren't ready for a 12-month SAP implementation.
They needed visibility without the enterprise overhead.

DESIRE:
Within 6 weeks, tracking calls dropped 85%. The dispatch team
had time to actually optimize routes and negotiate rates.
Result: ₹1.2 Cr saved in the first year.

ACTION:

### BAB Framework (Before-After-Bridge)

**Structure**:
```
BEFORE: Paint their current painful reality
↓
AFTER: Show the transformed state
↓
BRIDGE: Explain how to get there
```

**Fretron Example**:
```
BEFORE:
Your morning starts with a stack of delivery exceptions.
Your team scrambles to call carriers, track down shipments,
and field angry customer calls. By noon, you're already
behind on everything else.

AFTER:
Imagine starting your day with a dashboard showing every
shipment's status. Exceptions are flagged automatically.
Your team focuses on solving problems, not finding them.
Customers get proactive updates before they even ask.

BRIDGE:
Fretron transforms logistics operations in 6-8 weeks.
No massive IT project. No 12-month implementation.
Just real-time visibility that works.

**Structure**:

PUSH: Drive to action
```

**Fretron Example**:
```
PROMISE:
