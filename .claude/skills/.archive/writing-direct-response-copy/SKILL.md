# Writing Direct Response Copy for Fretron

Write persuasive copy that hooks attention and drives specific actions.

## When to Use This Skill

- Writing headlines and hooks
- Creating landing page copy
- Drafting ad copy (LinkedIn, Google)
- Writing sales emails
- Crafting CTAs that convert
- Improving existing copy for conversion

## Core Direct Response Frameworks

### PAS: Problem → Agitate → Solution

**Problem**: State the pain clearly
**Agitate**: Make it feel urgent/costly
**Solution**: Present your answer

**Fretron Example:**
> **Problem**: "Your dispatchers are juggling 15 Excel sheets and 50 WhatsApp groups."
> **Agitate**: "Every day, loads slip, trucks wait, and you're bleeding ₹2-3 lakhs in detention and missed consolidation."
> **Solution**: "Fretron gives you one screen to see, decide, and dispatch - in 6 weeks, not 6 months."

### AIDA: Attention → Interest → Desire → Action

**Attention**: Hook with pattern interrupt
**Interest**: Explain the opportunity
**Desire**: Show transformation
**Action**: Clear next step

### BAB: Before → After → Bridge

**Before**: Current painful state
**After**: Desired future state
**Bridge**: How you get them there

## Hook Formulas That Work

### 1. Specific Number + Outcome
- "8-15% freight cost reduction on your top lanes"
- "3-5 point OTIF improvement in 90 days"

### 2. Question That Exposes Pain
- "How much are you losing to spot buying chaos?"
- "What's your cost per MT-km? (Most can't answer)"

### 3. Contrarian Statement
- "Your TMS isn't the problem. Your visibility is."
- "Stop chasing trucks. Start managing exceptions."

### 4. Specific Timeframe + Outcome
- "Go live in 6 weeks, not 6 months"
- "See ROI in Q1, not next fiscal year"

### 5. "If... Then" Format
- "If you're shipping 50+ loads/day on Excel, you're leaving ₹20L+ on the table"

### 6. Social Proof Lead
- "How [Similar Company] cut freight costs by 12%"

### Emails

## Body Copy Principles

### 1. Lead with Outcome, Not Features
**Bad**: "Fretron has real-time GPS tracking"
**Good**: "See every shipment's location without calling anyone"

### 2. Use Specific Numbers
**Bad**: "Reduce costs significantly"
**Good**: "Cut freight costs by 8-15% on your top 10 lanes"

### 3. Name the Enemy
**Bad**: "Improve your processes"
**Good**: "Kill the Excel chaos and WhatsApp firefighting"

### 4. Show the Contrast
**Bad**: "Fast implementation"
**Good**: "Go live in 6 weeks. Not 6 months like Oracle told you."

### 5. Use "You" Language
**Bad**: "Fretron enables companies to..."
**Good**: "You get one dashboard for all your lanes..."

### 6. Include Proof
- Customer quotes
- Specific results ("12% reduction for [Company Type]")
- Logos of recognizable customers

## CTA Writing Rules

### Be Specific, Not Generic
**Bad**: "Submit" / "Learn More" / "Download"
**Good**: "Calculate My Savings" / "Get My Audit" / "See It In Action"

### Match CTA to Funnel Stage
- **Top**: "Get the Calculator" / "See Benchmarks"
- **Middle**: "Book Your Audit" / "Watch Demo"
- **Bottom**: "Start Free Pilot" / "Talk to Expert"

### Create Urgency (When Real)
- "Limited audit slots this quarter"
- "Pilot pricing ends [date]"

## Copy for Different Channels

### LinkedIn Ads
- Lead with question or stat
- 1-2 short sentences
- Clear CTA
- Example: "Shipping 100+ loads/day? Most mid-market shippers leave ₹15-25L/year on the table. Calculate yours → [link]"

### Google Ads
- Include keyword in headline
- Specific numbers/outcomes
- Example: "Freight TMS - 6 Week Go-Live | 8-15% Cost Reduction | Free Audit"

### Cold Email
- Subject: Short, curiosity-driven
- Open: Relevance hook (why them, why now)
- Body: 2-3 sentences max
- CTA: Single, easy next step
- See `../designing-email-sequences/` for full sequences

### Sales Page
- Long-form follows AIDA
- Multiple proof points throughout
- Handle objections inline
- Repeat CTA 3-4 times

## Copy Quality Checklist

Before publishing:

- [ ] Hook grabs attention in first 3 seconds
- [ ] Clear who this is for
- [ ] Specific outcome promised
- [ ] Proof included (numbers, quotes, logos)
- [ ] Objections addressed
- [ ] Single clear CTA
- [ ] "You" language throughout
- [ ] No jargon (or jargon is explained)
- [ ] Reads at 6th-8th grade level

## Fretron Voice Guidelines

**Tone**: Confident, direct, outcome-focused
**Avoid**: Enterprise-speak, buzzwords, vague promises
**Use**: Specific numbers, Indian context (₹, Lakhs/Crores), logistics terminology

**Good Voice**:
> "Your dispatch team shouldn't need 15 tabs open. With Fretron, they need one."

**Bad Voice**:
> "Fretron's integrated platform leverages AI-driven insights to optimize your supply chain ecosystem."

## Fletch PMM's Capability-First Approach

From Fletch PMM: Lead with capabilities, not benefits or features.

### The Features → Capabilities → Benefits Chain

| Level | What It Is | Fretron Example |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Feature** | Technical aspect | "Real-time GPS tracking" |
| **Capability** | What you can now DO | "See every shipment's location without calling anyone" |
| **Benefit** | Business outcome | "Reduce tracking calls by 80%, save 40 hrs/week" |

**Key Insight**: Lead with capabilities, prove with features, close with benefits.

### Common Mistake: Leading with Benefits

**Wrong Order:**
> "Save time and reduce costs with our TMS"
(Vague, says nothing about what you DO)

**Right Order:**
> "See every shipment's location in real-time → powered by GPS + IoT → cuts tracking calls by 80%"
(Capability → Feature → Benefit)

### Capability-First Headlines

| Weak (Benefit-First) | Strong (Capability-First) |
|---------------------|---------------------------|
| "Reduce freight costs" | "Find hidden savings in your top 10 lanes" |
| "Improve efficiency" | "One screen to see, decide, and dispatch" |
| "Better visibility" | "Track every truck without a single phone call" |

### Testing Copy with the Capability Framework

Before publishing, ask:
1. Does this explain what they can NOW DO?
2. Is the capability specific (not vague)?
3. Do features support (not lead) the capability?
4. Is the benefit measurable?
