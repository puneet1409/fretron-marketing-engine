# Trust Ladder Worksheets

Practical tools for mapping and building trust throughout the buyer journey.

## The Trust Ladder Model

### Trust Levels Defined

| Level | State | What They Think | What They'll Accept |
|-------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| 0 | Unknown | "Who are you?" | Nothing - we have no right to ask |
| 1 | Aware | "I've heard of you" | Low-commitment content offers |
| 2 | Interested | "You might be relevant" | Mid-commitment engagement |
| 3 | Evaluating | "I'm seriously considering you" | High-commitment asks |
| 4 | Committed | "I've chosen you" | Partnership requests |
| 5 | Advocating | "I recommend you" | Referral and case study asks |

### The Core Principle

**The ask must match the trust level established.**

Every interaction should:
1. Provide value appropriate to current trust level
2. Build toward the next trust level
3. Never skip levels or over-ask

## Worksheet 1: Trust Level Audit

### Current State Assessment

**For each touchpoint, audit trust alignment:**

| Touchpoint | Current Ask | Required Trust Level | Actual Trust Level | Gap |
|------------|-------------|---------------------|-------------------|-----|
| Homepage | Book Demo | Level 3 | Level 1 | -2 |
| Blog post | Subscribe | Level 1 | Level 1 | ✓ |
| Cold email | Schedule call | Level 3 | Level 0 | -3 |
| LinkedIn ad | Download guide | Level 1 | Level 0 | -1 |
| Case study page | Request consultation | Level 3 | Level 2 | -1 |

**Gap Analysis**:
- Negative gap = Ask too aggressive for trust level
- Zero = Ask matches trust level
- Positive gap = Opportunity to ask for more
