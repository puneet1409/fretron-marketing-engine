# Building Trust Progressively for Fretron

Design journeys that build trust step-by-step, earning the right to bigger asks.

## When to Use This Skill

- Designing nurture sequences
- Planning multi-touch campaigns
- Creating content that builds toward conversion
- Accelerating trust for urgent opportunities
- Understanding why leads aren't progressing

## The Trust Building Philosophy

> **"To establish trust, offer something of value, relevance, and credibility matching your current trust level, then progressively build."**

**Trust is earned through:**
1. **Value** - Giving before asking
2. **Relevance** - Showing you understand their world
3. **Credibility** - Proving you can deliver

**Trust is built by:**
- Consistent, helpful interactions
- Delivered promises (small ones first)
- Third-party validation
- Time and repeated exposure

## The Trust Ladder

```
Level 5: ADVOCATE ──────────────────────────────────►
         "I'd stake my reputation on them"

Level 4: TRUSTING ──────────────────────────────────►
         "I'd commit time and resources"

Level 3: ENGAGED ───────────────────────────────────►
         "I'd have a conversation"

Level 2: INTERESTED ────────────────────────────────►
         "I'd consume their content"

Level 1: AWARE ─────────────────────────────────────►
         "I've heard of them"

Level 0: UNKNOWN ───────────────────────────────────►
         "Who are they?"
```

**Each level must be earned before requesting the next level's commitment.**

## Trust Building Ingredients

### 1. Value (Give Before Ask)

**Value at each level:**

| Trust Level | Value to Provide |
|-------------|------------------|
| 0→1 | Helpful content in their feed |
| 1→2 | Useful insight, tool, or resource |
| 2→3 | Personalized help, specific answer |
| 3→4 | Tailored analysis, real consultation |
| 4→5 | Delivered results, exceeded expectations |

**Value Types:**
- **Educational**: "Here's how to think about X"
- **Practical**: "Here's a tool/template for X"
- **Insight**: "Here's what we're seeing in your industry"
- **Connection**: "Here's someone you should know"
- **Shortcut**: "Here's how to do X faster"

### 2. Relevance (Show You Understand)

**Relevance signals:**
- Mention their industry specifically
- Reference their company/situation
- Acknowledge their role's challenges
- Use their language, not yours
- Cite peers they'd recognize

**Relevance at each level:**

| Level | Relevance Demonstration |
|-------|------------------------|
| 0→1 | Industry-specific content |
| 1→2 | Role-specific challenges |
| 2→3 | Company-specific observation |
| 3→4 | Situation-specific insight |
| 4→5 | Personalized solution |

### 3. Credibility (Prove You Can Deliver)

**Credibility types:**
- **Social proof**: "100+ companies like you..."
- **Peer proof**: "Similar company achieved X"
- **Expert proof**: "We specialize in Y"
- **Data proof**: "Research shows Z"
- **Demonstration proof**: "Here's it working"

**Credibility at each level:**

| Level | Credibility Evidence |
|-------|---------------------|
| 0→1 | Known brand/logo presence |
| 1→2 | Industry expertise signals |
| 2→3 | Case studies, customer quotes |
| 3→4 | References, detailed proof |
| 4→5 | Pilot/trial results |

## Progressive Trust Sequences

### Sequence 1: Content-Based Trust Building

**Week 1-2: Value (Awareness)**
- Publish helpful content in their channels
- No outreach, just presence
- Build pattern recognition ("I keep seeing them")

**Week 3-4: Relevance (Interest)**
- Share industry-specific insight
- Offer useful resource (ungated)
- Show you understand their world

**Week 5-6: Credibility (Engagement)**
- Introduce peer proof (case study)
- Share specific results from similar companies
- Start light conversation

**Week 7-8: Personalization (Trust)**
- Provide company-specific insight
- Offer tailored consultation
- Propose specific next step

### Sequence 2: Outreach-Based Trust Building

**Touch 1: Pure Value**
```
"Noticed you're at [Company]. Here's an insight about [industry] that might be useful. [Value]. No ask, just sharing."
```

**Touch 2: Relevance + Value**
```
"Following up with more context. Companies like [Company] typically face [challenge]. Here's how some are approaching it: [insight]."
```

**Touch 3: Credibility**
```
"[Similar company] was dealing with the same thing. They [specific action] and saw [specific result]. Here's the case study if you want detail."
```

**Touch 4: Soft Ask**
```
"Curious how you're thinking about this at [Company]. Worth comparing notes? 10 minutes, no pitch."
```

**Touch 5: Direct Ask (if signals positive)**
```
"Based on our conversation, seems like a quick demo might be useful to see how this works for [specific situation]. Up for it?"
```

### Sequence 3: Event/Trigger-Based Acceleration

When a trigger appears, you can accelerate—but still respect trust:

**With trigger, trust still low:**
- Acknowledge trigger with value, not pitch
- "Congrats on [trigger]. Here's insight relevant to what you're now facing."
- Accelerate touchpoints, not ask level

**With trigger, trust moderate:**
- Acknowledge trigger with specific help
- "Given [trigger], you might find [specific resource] useful. Happy to discuss."
- Can ask for conversation sooner

**With trigger, trust high:**
- Acknowledge trigger with offer
- "Given [trigger], let me show you specifically how we'd help. Demo?"
- Direct ask is appropriate

## Trust Accelerators

**Things that speed up trust building:**

1. **Warm Introduction**
   - Referral from trusted source = instant Level 2-3
   - "John from [Company] suggested I reach out"

2. **Shared Experience**
   - Same industry, role, challenge
   - "I worked in logistics for 10 years before this"

3. **Demonstrated Expertise**
   - Show don't tell
   - Give insight that demonstrates deep knowledge

4. **Quick Win Delivery**
   - Small promise, fast delivery
   - "Here's that analysis I mentioned" (next day)

5. **Social Proof Saturation**
   - Peers they know using/endorsing
   - "Your colleague at [Sister Company] is a customer"

6. **Transparency**
   - Admit limitations honestly
   - "We're not right for everyone. Here's who we're best for."

## Trust Destroyers (Avoid)

**Things that kill trust instantly:**

1. **Mismatched Ask**
   - Asking for demo when trust is zero
   - Too aggressive, too soon

2. **Broken Promise**
   - "I'll send that tomorrow" → Never sends
   - Trust reset to zero

3. **Irrelevance**
   - Content that shows you don't know their world
   - Generic outreach

4. **Deception**
   - Bait-and-switch tactics
   - Hidden agendas

5. **Pushy Behavior**
   - "Checking in" repeatedly
   - Not accepting "no" or "not now"

6. **Self-Focus**
   - Talking about yourself, not them
   - "We're the leading..." before earning the right
