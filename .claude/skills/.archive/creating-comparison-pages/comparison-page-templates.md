## When Excel Works

Be honest—Excel is fine for:

- Single-person operations

---

✓ You have more than 50 shipments/day
✓ Multiple people manage logistics
✓ Customers demand visibility
✓ You're missing cost optimization opportunities
✓ Errors are becoming frequent
✓ Data is siloed and inconsistent

## What Changes with a TMS

### Before (Excel)

- Call carriers for every status update
- Manually enter data (duplicates, errors)
- End-of-month reconciliation nightmare
- No visibility until problems escalate
- Reactive firefighting

### After (TMS)

- Real-time visibility without calls
- Automated data capture
- Daily reconciliation
- Proactive exception alerts
- Strategic optimization
