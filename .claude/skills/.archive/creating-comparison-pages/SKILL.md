# Creating Comparison Pages for Fretron

Build SEO-optimized comparison pages that capture competitor search traffic and convert to demos.

## When to Use This Skill

- Creating "Fretron vs [Competitor]" pages
- Building "Best TMS for [Industry]" pages
- Targeting "alternative to [Competitor]" keywords
- Optimizing existing comparison content

## Trust Philosophy Integration

**Competitor searchers have HIGH intent but LOW trust in you.**

They know the competitor. They're evaluating. Your job:
1. **Be fair** - Acknowledge competitor strengths (builds credibility)
2. **Be specific** - Generic claims reduce trust
3. **Lead with proof** - Let customers speak for you
4. **Match the ask** - Comparison guide before demo

## April Dunford's Competitive Alternatives Framework

From "Obviously Awesome": Start comparison pages by understanding what customers ACTUALLY compare you to.

### Identifying Real Competitive Alternatives

**Key Questions:**
- What are prospects using TODAY? (not theoretical competitors)
- What would they do if you didn't exist?
- Include "do nothing" as a valid alternative

**Avoid Phantom Competitors:**
| Phantom Competitor | Real Alternative |
|-------------------|------------------|
| "We compete with SAP" (aspiration) | "They're using Excel + WhatsApp" (reality) |
| "Our main competitor is Oracle" | "They're doing it manually" |
| "We're like Salesforce for logistics" | "They have 15 spreadsheets" |

### Structuring Comparisons by Alternative Type

**Against Enterprise TMS (SAP, Oracle):**
- Lead with: Speed, simplicity, cost
- Acknowledge: Their depth, ecosystem
- Target: "Too complex for your needs"

**Against Point Solutions:**
- Lead with: Integration, completeness
- Acknowledge: Ease of single function
- Target: "Fragmentation pain"

**Against Manual/Excel:**
- Lead with: Visibility, efficiency, scale
- Acknowledge: Familiarity, low cost
- Target: "You've outgrown it"

**Against Do Nothing:**
- Lead with: Cost of inaction, competitive risk
- Acknowledge: Change is hard
- Target: "What's this really costing you?"
