## Voice by Channel

### Website Copy

**Tone**: Confident, benefit-focused, proof-backed

**Do**:
- Lead with outcomes, not features
- Use specific numbers (15-25%, not "significant")
- Include industry context (steel, cement, FMCG)
- End sections with clear next steps

**Don't**:
- Use vague superlatives ("best-in-class", "world-leading")
- Over-explain how things work technically
- Hide CTAs or make them weak
- Sound like every other SaaS company

**Example**:
```
INSTEAD OF:
"Our cutting-edge platform leverages AI to provide
best-in-class visibility into your logistics operations."

WRITE:
"See every shipment in real-time. Stop making 500 tracking
calls a day. Our customers reduce tracking effort by 85%
in the first 90 days."
```

---

### Email Copy

**Tone**: Personal, helpful, action-oriented

**Do**:
- Write like a person, not a company
- Get to the point quickly
- Provide clear value in every email
- Use "you" more than "we"

**Don't**:
- Start with "I hope this email finds you well"
- Write walls of text
- Be overly formal or stiff
- Send emails without clear purpose

**Subject Line Principles**:
- Specific > Clever
- Benefit > Feature
- Short (under 50 characters)
- No ALL CAPS or excessive punctuation

**Email Examples**:

```
COLD EMAIL - BAD:
Subject: Fretron TMS - India's Leading Transportation Management System

Dear Sir/Madam,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to introduce
Fretron, India's premier TMS solution...

---

COLD EMAIL - GOOD:
Subject: Quick question about [Company]'s logistics

Hi [Name],

Noticed [Company] is expanding your [City] operations.
When logistics volume doubles, tracking calls usually
triple. Is that something you're seeing?

We helped [Similar Company] handle 2x volume with the
same team. Happy to share what worked if useful.

[Name]
```

---

### LinkedIn Content

**Tone**: Conversational, insight-driven, engagement-focused

**Do**:
- Share genuine insights, not promotional content
- Tell stories with specific details
- Ask questions to drive engagement
- Be human (founders, team members, not just brand)

**Don't**:
- Sound like a press release
- Use hashtag spam (#TMS #Logistics #Supply #Chain)
- Post generic industry news without perspective
- Only talk about Fretron

**Post Types**:

1. **War Story** (highest engagement)
```
We almost lost our biggest customer last year.

Not because of our product. Because of an implementation
promise we couldn't keep.

Here's what happened and what we learned:

[Story with specific details]

Lesson: Under-promise. Over-deliver. Every time.
```

2. **Industry Insight**
```
Everyone talks about freight cost reduction.

But here's what actually moves the needle for
mid-market manufacturers:

1. Detention (30-40% of "hidden" costs)
2. Rate leakage (paying above contracted rates)
3. Reconciliation delays (cash flow impact)

The tracking and visibility? That's just step one.

What's your biggest freight cost blind spot?
```

3. **Customer Success** (without being promotional)
```
Had a call with a logistics head yesterday.

He said something that stuck with me:

"We used to spend 4 hours a day on tracking calls.
Now we spend 4 hours a week on improving operations."

That's the shift. From firefighting to optimizing.

What would your team do with those extra hours?
```

### Sales Conversations

**Tone**: Consultative, curious, honest

**Do**:
- Ask questions before presenting
- Acknowledge when we're not the right fit
- Use customer language, not jargon
- Be specific about limitations

**Don't**:
- Pitch before understanding
- Bash competitors
- Overpromise on timelines or results
- Use pressure tactics

**Discovery Phrases**:
- "Help me understand how you handle [X] today..."
- "What's driving the interest in solving this now?"
- "If you did nothing, what happens in 6 months?"
- "What's worked/not worked when you've tried to solve this before?"

**Honest Positioning**:
```
INSTEAD OF:
"We're the best TMS in the market."

SAY:
"We're purpose-built for mid-market manufacturing in India.
If you're a 3PL or e-commerce company, we're probably not
the right fit. But if you're running 100-500 shipments a day
from multiple plants, that's exactly where we excel."
```

---

### Customer Success Communication

**Tone**: Supportive, proactive, partnership-oriented

**Do**:
- Lead with the customer's goals, not our metrics
- Proactively surface issues before they escalate
- Celebrate wins together
- Be honest about what's working and what isn't

**Don't**:
- Be defensive when things go wrong
- Only reach out when renewing
- Use corporate-speak in crisis
- Treat every customer the same

**QBR Intro Example**:
```
INSTEAD OF:
"Let's review your usage metrics and discuss renewal..."

SAY:
"Last quarter you set a goal to reduce tracking calls by 50%.
You're at 62%. Let's talk about what's driving that and
what's next on your roadmap."
```
