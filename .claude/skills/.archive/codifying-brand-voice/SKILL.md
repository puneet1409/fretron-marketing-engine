## Fretron Writing Guidelines

### Sentence Structure
- **Short sentences preferred** (under 20 words)
- **One idea per sentence**
- **Active voice** over passive
- **Vary rhythm** - mix short and medium sentences

**Good:**
> "Your dispatch team needs one screen. Not fifteen. Fretron gives them that."

**Bad:**
> "The operational efficiency of dispatch teams can be significantly enhanced through the utilization of our unified dashboard solution."

### Paragraph Structure
- **2-3 sentences max** per paragraph
- **Line breaks** create white space
- **Use bullets** for lists (3+ items)
- **Headers** break up long content

### Word Choice

**Preferred Vocabulary:**

| Instead of | Use |
|------------|-----|
| Utilize | Use |
| Leverage | Use, Apply |
| Optimize | Improve |
| Solutions | What we do, Tools |
| Innovative | (skip - show don't tell) |
| Best-in-class | (skip - prove it instead) |
| Seamlessly | (skip - buzzword) |
| Ecosystem | (only if necessary) |

**Logistics Terms:**
- Use industry terms correctly
- Explain jargon when writing for broader audience
- OTIF, PKMMT, FTL, LTL are fine for industry readers

**Indian Context:**
- ₹ not INR or Rs.
- Lakhs/Crores for large numbers
- Reference Indian cities, industries
- E-way bill, GST as relevant compliance

### Numbers & Data
- Use numerals for impact: "8-15%" not "eight to fifteen percent"
- Specific > vague: "₹18L saved" not "significant savings"
- Round when appropriate: "50+ customers" not "53 customers"
- Use Indian number formatting when relevant

### Punctuation
- **Em dashes** for emphasis—like this
- **Periods** for short, punchy sentences
- **Colons** to introduce lists
- **Minimal exclamation marks** - one per page max
- **Oxford comma** for clarity

## Voice in Action: Before/After

### Example 1: Feature Description
