# Matching Ask to Trust for Fretron

Diagnose trust level and recommend appropriate asks that match.

## When to Use This Skill

- Deciding what CTA to use on a page/email
- Diagnosing why outreach isn't getting responses
- Planning campaign ask progression
- Evaluating if we're asking too much too soon
- Training team on trust-appropriate selling

## Core Principle

> **"The ask must match the trust level you have established."**

Asking for a demo when trust is zero = low conversion + brand damage.
Asking for a demo when trust is high = natural next step.

## Trust Level Framework

### Trust Level Definitions

| Level | Name | Description | How You Got Here |
|-------|------|-------------|------------------|
| 0 | Unknown | Never heard of you | Cold list, purchased data |
| 1 | Aware | Seen your name somewhere | Ad impression, passed content |
| 2 | Interested | Engaged with content | Downloaded, liked, commented |
| 3 | Engaged | Active interaction | Replied, attended event, returned |
| 4 | Trusting | Ready for commitment | Multiple touches, responded positively |
| 5 | Advocating | Would recommend | Customer, champion, referrer |

### Trust-Appropriate Asks

| Trust Level | Appropriate Ask | Inappropriate Ask |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 0 (Unknown) | Nothing. Give value. | Any ask at all. |
| 1 (Aware) | "Follow us", "Read this" | Email signup, demo |
| 2 (Interested) | Content download, calculator | Demo, meeting |
| 3 (Engaged) | 10-min chat, quick insight | Full demo, proposal |
| 4 (Trusting) | Demo, audit, consultation | Pilot, contract |
| 5 (Advocating) | Referral, case study, pilot | N/A (earned all asks) |

## Trust Mismatch Diagnosis

### Signs You're Asking Too Much

- Low reply rates to outreach (<5%)
- High bounce rate on landing pages (>70%)
- Form abandonment after viewing
- "Not interested" or "Remove me" responses
- Ghosting after initial interest

### Signs You're Asking Too Little

- Engaged contacts not progressing
- Lots of content consumption, no conversions
- "I didn't know you had a demo" feedback
- Stuck in nurture forever
- High trust, no next step offered

### Fixing Trust Mismatches

**If asking too much:**
1. Remove demo CTA from cold outreach
2. Add value layer before ask
3. Use progressive profiling
4. Lead with ungated content
5. Ask "Would you like..." not "Schedule now"

**If asking too little:**
1. Add CTA to engaged contacts
2. Create explicit next step
3. Send "Ready to talk?" touchpoint
4. Use intent signals to trigger sales
5. Don't leave warm leads in nurture limbo

## Application by Channel

### Website Conversion Optimization

**Current**: Homepage → "Book Demo" button
**Problem**: Most visitors are trust Level 1-2
**Fix**: Homepage → "See how it works" (video) → Nurture → Demo

**Current**: Every page → Same demo CTA
**Problem**: Trust varies by page and visitor
**Fix**:
- First visit: Light CTA (content)
- Return visit: Medium CTA (event)
- High-intent page: Strong CTA (demo)

### Outbound Cadence

**Current**: Email 1 → "15 minutes for a demo?"
**Problem**: Trust is zero
**Fix**:
- Email 1: Pure value (no ask)
- Email 2-3: Value + light engagement
- Email 4-5: Soft ask ("worth chatting?")

### ABM Campaign

**Current**: Target account → Immediate sales outreach
**Problem**: No trust built
**Fix**:
- Week 1-4: Visibility (ads, content)
- Week 5-8: Engagement (personalized value)
- Week 9-12: Conversation (earned the right)
