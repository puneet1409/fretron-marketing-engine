# Trust-Ask Calibration Guide

Precise frameworks for ensuring every ask matches the trust you've earned.

## The Trust-Ask Equation

### Core Formula

```
APPROPRIATE ASK = f(Trust Level, Relationship Depth, Value Delivered)

If Ask Commitment > Trust Earned → Rejection/Damage
If Ask Commitment = Trust Earned → Acceptance/Progress
If Ask Commitment < Trust Earned → Missed Opportunity
```

### Ask Commitment Levels

| Level | Commitment Type | Examples |
|-------|-----------------|----------|
| 1 | Attention (seconds) | Read headline, view post |
| 2 | Time (<5 min) | Read article, watch short video |
| 3 | Contact info (email) | Download content, subscribe |
| 4 | Detailed info | Form with company details |
| 5 | Calendar time | Meeting, call, webinar |
| 6 | Internal advocacy | Share with colleagues |
| 7 | Organizational commitment | Budget, contract, implementation |

## Trust-Ask Matrix

### Detailed Mapping

| Trust Level | Max Ask Level | Appropriate Asks | Over-Asks (Avoid) |
|-------------|---------------|------------------|-------------------|
| 0 (Unknown) | 1-2 | Read content, view insight | Any contact info |
| 1 (Aware) | 2-3 | Email for valuable content | Phone, meeting |
| 2 (Interested) | 3-4 | Detailed form, short call | Full demo, proposal |
| 3 (Evaluating) | 4-6 | Demo, references, pilot | Contract, full commitment |
| 4 (Committed) | 6-7 | Expansion, case study | Public advocacy |
| 5 (Advocating) | 7+ | Referrals, speaking | Nothing off-limits |

### Channel-Specific Calibration

**Cold Outreach (Trust Level 0)**:

| Channel | Max Ask | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Cold email | Read/Reply | "Thought this might be relevant - reply if interested" |
| LinkedIn connection | Accept + Read | Brief note, no pitch |
| Cold call | 60-second conversation | Permission to continue |
| Direct mail | Visit URL | Curiosity driver only |

**Inbound Content (Trust Level 1-2)**:

| Source | Inferred Trust | Max Ask |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| Organic blog visitor | 1 | Email for upgrade content |
| Webinar registrant | 1-2 | Post-webinar call offer |
| Content downloader | 1-2 | Follow-up email sequence |
| Pricing page visitor | 2 | Demo request |
| Demo request | 2-3 | Discovery call |

**Sales Engaged (Trust Level 2-3)**:

| Stage | Trust Level | Max Ask |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Post-discovery | 2-3 | Technical deep-dive |
| Post-demo | 3 | Reference call, pilot |
| Post-reference | 3-4 | Proposal, commercial terms |
| Post-proposal | 4 | Contract, decision |

## Value-Before-Ask Protocol

### The 3:1 Rule

Deliver 3 units of value before making 1 ask of equivalent commitment.

**Example Sequence**:
```
Touch 1: VALUE - Relevant industry insight (no ask)
Touch 2: VALUE - Useful benchmark data (no ask)
Touch 3: VALUE - Specific recommendation (no ask)
Touch 4: ASK - "Want to discuss how this applies to you?"
```

### Value Units by Type

| Value Type | Unit Value | Examples |
|------------|------------|----------|
| Generic insight | 0.5 | Industry news share |
| Relevant insight | 1.0 | Specific to their situation |
| Personalized insight | 2.0 | Research on their company |
| Actionable resource | 1.5 | Template, tool, checklist |
| Introduction/connection | 2.0 | Relevant person intro |
| Problem-solving help | 3.0 | Direct assistance |

### Ask Units by Type

| Ask Type | Unit Cost | Calibration |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Read content | 0.5 | Almost always appropriate |
| Email capture | 1.0 | Needs 2-3 value units first |
| Phone number | 2.0 | Needs 4-6 value units first |
| Meeting request | 3.0 | Needs 6-9 value units first |
| Internal referral | 4.0 | Needs 8-12 value units first |
| Budget discussion | 5.0 | Needs established relationship |

## Touchpoint Calibration Templates

### Email Sequence Calibration

**Email 1 (Trust Level ~0)**:
```
Purpose: Establish relevance
Ask Level: 1 (Read/Reply)

✓ DO: Share insight relevant to their situation
✓ DO: Ask simple question to gauge interest
✗ DON'T: Ask for meeting
✗ DON'T: Request phone call
✗ DON'T: Push product
```

**Email 2 (Trust Level ~0.5)**:
```
Purpose: Deliver additional value
Ask Level: 1-2 (Read/Reply/Small action)

✓ DO: Build on previous touch
✓ DO: Offer useful resource
✓ DO: Ask if topic resonates
✗ DON'T: Escalate to meeting ask yet
```

**Email 3 (Trust Level ~1)**:
```
Purpose: Bridge to conversation
Ask Level: 2-3 (Low-commitment call)

✓ DO: Reference previous value delivered
✓ DO: Offer specific, time-bound ask
✓ DO: Provide easy out
✗ DON'T: Assume they want full demo
```

### Landing Page Calibration

**Homepage**:
```
Visitor Trust Level: 0-1 (Unknown/Aware)
Appropriate Primary CTA: Learn More / See How It Works
Appropriate Secondary CTA: Download Guide (email)
Over-Ask: "Buy Now" / "Start Free Trial" / "Book Demo"
```

**Feature Page**:
```
Visitor Trust Level: 1-2 (Aware/Interested)
Appropriate Primary CTA: See Demo / Get More Info
Appropriate Secondary CTA: Download Related Content
Over-Ask: "Get Pricing" / "Start Implementation"
```

**Pricing Page**:
```
Visitor Trust Level: 2-3 (Interested/Evaluating)
Appropriate Primary CTA: Get Custom Quote / Talk to Sales
Appropriate Secondary CTA: See Full Feature List
Over-Ask: "Sign Contract Now"
```

**Case Study Page**:
```
Visitor Trust Level: 2 (Interested)
Appropriate Primary CTA: See How We Can Help You

```

## Ask Escalation Framework

### When to Escalate

**Positive Signals (Ready for Higher Ask)**:
- Multiple content engagements
- Return visits to high-intent pages
- Questions about implementation/pricing
- Brings in additional stakeholders
- Asks for references

**Hold Signals (Maintain Current Ask Level)**:
- Single touchpoint only
- No engagement with follow-ups
- Generic questions only
- No urgency indicators

**De-escalation Signals (Reduce Ask Level)**:
- Declined meeting request
- Unsubscribed from emails
- Explicit "not now" feedback
- Went dark after engagement

### Escalation Sequences

**Standard Escalation Path**:
```
Level 1: Content consumption (no ask)
    ↓ [2-3 value touches]
Level 2: Email capture (lead magnet)
    ↓ [Engagement confirmation]
Level 3: Discovery call offer
    ↓ [Call completed]
Level 4: Demo/assessment offer
    ↓ [Demo completed]
Level 5: Proposal/pilot discussion
    ↓ [Stakeholder alignment]
Level 6: Commercial commitment
```

**Accelerated Path (High Intent Signals)**:
```
High-intent signal detected (demo request, pricing inquiry)
    ↓
Skip to appropriate level
    ↓
But still deliver value before escalating further
```

## Common Over-Ask Mistakes

### Mistake 1: The Premature Demo

**Symptom**: Pushing demo to everyone who downloads content

**Problem**: Demo requires Trust Level 2-3; content download indicates Level 1

**Fix**: Nurture with additional value, offer assessment first

---

### Mistake 2: The Cold Call Close

**Symptom**: Asking for meeting in first cold outreach

**Problem**: Meeting requires Trust Level 2+; cold call is Level 0

**Fix**: Ask only for permission to share relevant insight

---

### Mistake 3: The Eager Follow-Up

**Symptom**: Immediately asking "ready to move forward?" after demo

**Problem**: Commitment requires Level 3-4; one demo doesn't establish that

**Fix**: Offer references, answer questions, provide decision support

---

### Mistake 4: The Homepage Hard Sell

**Symptom**: "Start Free Trial" as primary CTA on homepage

**Problem**: Trial requires Level 2-3; homepage visitors are Level 0-1

**Fix**: Lead with value proposition, offer lower-commitment next step

---

### Mistake 5: The Reference Ambush

**Symptom**: Asking new customer for reference/case study immediately

**Problem**: Advocacy requires Level 5; new customer is Level 4

**Fix**: Wait for demonstrated success and relationship depth

---

## Trust Repair Protocol

### When You've Over-Asked

**Step 1: Recognize the signal**
- Declined request
- Ghosting after ask
- Explicit pushback
- Reduced engagement

**Step 2: Acknowledge without over-explaining**
```
"I may have jumped ahead there. Let me take a step back."
```

**Step 3: Return to value delivery**
```
"Here's something that might be useful regardless of timing."
[Deliver relevant value with zero ask]
```

**Step 4: Let them re-engage**
```
"When/if it makes sense to continue the conversation,
I'm here. No rush."
```

**Step 5: Resume at appropriate level**
- Wait for positive signal
- Start one level below previous ask
- Rebuild trust through value

## Ask Calibration Checklist

Before making any ask, verify:

- [ ] What trust level have we established?
- [ ] Is this ask appropriate for that level?
- [ ] What value have we delivered to earn this ask?
- [ ] Is the ask clearly communicated (specific, time-bound)?
- [ ] Is there an easy way to decline without awkwardness?
- [ ] What's the next-lower ask if this feels like too much?
- [ ] Have we given them a reason to say yes beyond "we want to sell"?
