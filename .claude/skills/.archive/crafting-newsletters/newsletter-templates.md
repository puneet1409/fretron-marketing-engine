### Example Issue

```
SUBJECT: 40% of detention costs are invisible (here's why)

---

Hey [First Name],

Every logistics leader I talk to knows detention is a problem.

But here's what surprised me in our analysis of 50+ implementations:

**40% of detention costs never show up on invoices.**

Why? Because they're absorbed as:
- Overtime pay for waiting drivers
- Expedited shipments to make up time
- Lost capacity on subsequent loads
- Customer penalties for late delivery

A steel manufacturer we work with discovered ₹45 lakh in "hidden"
detention costs last quarter—costs that weren't in any freight invoice.

The visibility gap isn't just about knowing where your shipments are.
It's about understanding the true cost of every delay.

**Question for you**: When was the last time you calculated your
*total* detention impact—not just what carriers charge?

---

⚡ QUICK HITS

1. **Diesel prices up 3% this month** — We're seeing carriers push
   for rate revisions. Now's the time to lock in Q2 contracts.

2. **OTIF reporting is becoming table stakes** — Three RFPs this
   week asked for real-time OTIF dashboards. Customer expectations
   are rising.

3. **Stat of the week**: Companies using automated tracking reduce
   customer escalations by 65%. Manual tracking = reactive firefighting.

💬 FROM THE TRENCHES

*"We thought our detention problem was ₹20 lakh/quarter.
Turns out it was ₹65 lakh when we counted the ripple effects."*

🏆 CUSTOMER SPOTLIGHT

**How [Customer Name] Reduced Tracking Calls by 85%**

When [Company] implemented Fretron, their dispatch team was
making 400+ tracking calls daily. Within 90 days, that dropped
to under 60.

"The team finally has time to focus on exceptions, not routine
tracking. That's where the real value is."
— [Name], Logistics Head

[Read the full story →]

---

💡 TIP OF THE MONTH

**Automate Your Exception Alerts**

Most teams set up basic tracking but miss exception automation.
Here's a quick win:

1. Go to Settings → Alerts → Exception Rules
2. Set threshold: "Shipment delayed > 2 hours"
3. Route to: Dispatch manager + Customer contact

This turns Fretron from "visibility tool" to "early warning system."

### Example Issue

```
SUBJECT: This week: New GST rules + the Excel exodus

---

THE BIG STORY

**New E-way Bill Changes Take Effect February 1**

The updated e-way bill requirements add new documentation
for inter-state shipments. Key changes:

- Additional verification for consignments >₹50,000
- Real-time vehicle tracking integration (for select states)
- New penalty structure for non-compliance

If you're running 100+ inter-state shipments daily, this
means more documentation overhead—unless you automate.
