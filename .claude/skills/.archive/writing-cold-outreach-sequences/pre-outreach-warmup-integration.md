# Pre-Outreach Warmup Integration

How to connect warmup activities with cold outreach for seamless trust building.

## The "Cold" Fallacy

**Common Mistake**: Treating Email 1 as first contact.

**Reality**: For properly executed outreach, Email 1 is the **first direct ask** after weeks of ambient familiarity.

```
WRONG Mental Model:
Email 1 → First time they hear from you

RIGHT Mental Model:
LinkedIn Follow (Week 1)
    ↓
Content Engagement (Week 2-3)
    ↓
LinkedIn Connection (Week 4)
    ↓
Email 1 (Week 5) ← They already recognize you
```

## Warmup → Outreach Handoff

### When to Start Email Sequence

**Tier 1 Accounts (Strategic)**

Start email sequence AFTER:
- [ ] 30+ days of LinkedIn visibility
- [ ] 5+ LinkedIn engagements (likes, comments)
- [ ] LinkedIn connection accepted
- [ ] At least one DM exchanged OR
- [ ] Website visit detected from account

**Tier 2 Accounts (Target)**

Start email sequence AFTER:
- [ ] 14+ days of LinkedIn visibility
- [ ] 3+ LinkedIn engagements
- [ ] LinkedIn connection requested (not necessarily accepted)
- [ ] Included in awareness advertising

**Tier 3 Accounts (Awareness)**

Can start email immediately BUT:
- [ ] Ensure in retargeting audiences
- [ ] Lower expectations for reply rate (1-3%)
- [ ] Use more scaled personalization (company-level only)

### Warmth Signals Before Email

| Signal | Warmth Points | Implication |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| LinkedIn connection accepted | +20 | They know who you are |
| Liked your post | +10 | Passive awareness |
| Commented on your post | +25 | Active engagement |
| Clicked on ad | +15 | Interest in content |
| Visited website | +20 | Researching you |
| Downloaded content | +30 | High interest |
| Replied to LinkedIn DM | +40 | Ready for conversation |

**Minimum warmth before Email 1:**
- Tier 1: 40+ points
- Tier 2: 20+ points
- Tier 3: 0 (truly cold acceptable)

## Channel Orchestration

### The Parallel Track Approach

Don't think "LinkedIn then Email" - think **parallel channels, different purposes**:

```
Week 1:
├── LinkedIn: Follow 3 key contacts
├── Ads: Awareness campaign starts
└── Email: Nothing yet

Week 2:
├── LinkedIn: Engage with their content
├── Ads: Continue awareness
└── Email: Nothing yet

Week 3:
├── LinkedIn: Share valuable content, tag if appropriate
├── Ads: Continue awareness
└── Email: Nothing yet

Week 4:
├── LinkedIn: Send connection request
├── Ads: Shift to engagement content
└── Email: Nothing yet

Week 5:
├── LinkedIn: DM with value (if connected)
├── Ads: Continue engagement
└── Email: Email 1 - Industry insight, no ask

Week 6-8:
├── LinkedIn: Continue engagement
├── Ads: Continue engagement
└── Email: Emails 2-3

Week 9-12:
├── LinkedIn: Soft ask via DM
├── Ads: Consideration content
└── Email: Emails 4-5, soft meeting ask
```

### Channel Selection by Persona

| Persona | Primary Channel | Secondary Channel | Avoid |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|-------|
| C-Level (CEO, CFO) | LinkedIn | Email | Cold call |
| VP/Director | LinkedIn + Email equal | Phone after engagement | Mass email |
| Manager | Email | LinkedIn | Nothing else |
| Analyst/User | Email | LinkedIn optional | Direct meeting ask |

**Key Insight**: Senior executives are more responsive on LinkedIn than email. They get 200+ emails/day but scroll LinkedIn during downtime.

## Sender-Recipient Relationship

### Before Email 1, Establish:

**LinkedIn Connection Status:**
- Connected → Reference it: "We connected on LinkedIn last month..."
- Pending → Don't reference, but they may recognize name
- Not connected → True cold, lower expectations

**Previous Interactions:**
- Engaged with your content → Reference it: "Noticed you liked my post on..."
- No engagement → Can't reference, start from zero

**Mutual Connections:**
- Have mutual → Use as social proof: "[Mutual] and I were discussing..."
- No mutual → Can't leverage, harder path

### Sender Profile Optimization

Before any outreach, ensure sender's LinkedIn is warm:

- [ ] Professional headshot
- [ ] Headline mentions helping [their industry]
- [ ] Recent posts on relevant topics (at least 2/month)
- [ ] 500+ connections (credibility signal)
- [ ] Recommendations from customers (social proof)

**Test**: Would you accept a connection request from this profile? If not, fix it first.

## Intent Signal Integration

### Starting Sequence Based on Signals

**Strong Intent Signals (Start immediately):**
- Visited pricing page
- Downloaded case study
- Requested demo (but didn't book)
- Searched for "Fretron" or competitor names

**Medium Intent Signals (Start with extra warmup):**
- Visited website 2+ times
- Engaged with multiple LinkedIn posts
- Clicked on advertising

**Weak Intent Signals (Continue warmup, don't start yet):**
- Single website visit
- Single LinkedIn engagement
- Opened marketing email but no click

### Pausing Sequence Based on Signals

**Positive Signals (Accelerate):**
- Multiple website visits → Move to Email 3 faster
- Replied positively → Exit sequence, book meeting
- Downloaded content → Add to high-priority follow-up

**Negative Signals (Pause/Remove):**
- Unsubscribed → Remove immediately
- Marked as spam → Remove, flag for exclusion
- Bounced → Remove, verify email
- Replied "not interested" → Remove, add to 6-month re-engage

**Neutral Signals (Continue as planned):**
- Opens but no reply → Continue sequence
- No opens → Try different subject line/time

## Handoff to Sales

### When Marketing Warmup Ends

**Ready for Sales Handoff:**

## Common Integration Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Email Before LinkedIn

**Wrong:**
```
Day 1: Email 1 sent
Day 5: LinkedIn connection request
```

**Right:**
```
Day 1: LinkedIn follow
Day 14: LinkedIn connection request
Day 30: Email 1 sent
```

### Mistake 2: Same Message Both Channels

**Wrong:**
LinkedIn DM: "Hi, I'd love to share how we can help..."
Email: "Hi, I'd love to share how we can help..."

**Right:**
LinkedIn DM: Short, casual, reference their content
Email: Slightly more formal, includes specific data/insight

### Mistake 3: No Coordination

**Wrong:**
Marketing sends email Tuesday.
SDR sends LinkedIn DM Tuesday.
AE calls Wednesday.
→ Prospect feels bombarded.

**Right:**
Marketing warmup complete.
Handoff meeting with notes.
SDR picks up with context.
→ Prospect feels known, not spammed.

### Mistake 4: Warmup Without Outreach

**Wrong:**
6 months of LinkedIn engagement.
Never send an email or ask for meeting.
→ Warmth fades, opportunity lost.

**Right:**
8 weeks of LinkedIn warmup.
Email sequence weeks 5-9.
Meeting ask by week 10.
→ Momentum maintained.

- Use → `selecting-target-accounts` to tier accounts before deciding warmup intensity
- Apply → `mapping-buyer-triggers` to time the warmup → outreach transition
