# Trust Ladder Email Templates

Complete email templates following the Trust Ladder methodology for Fretron cold outreach.

## The Trust Ladder Philosophy

**Core Principle**: Every email should match the current trust level and earn permission to climb one rung higher. Never skip rungs—build trust progressively.

**The Trust Ladder Rungs**:
- **Rung 0**: Unknown (give value, ask nothing)
- **Rung 1**: Aware (light engagement, no commitment)
- **Rung 2**: Interested (gated content, small ask)
- **Rung 3**: Engaged (conversation, time investment)
- **Rung 4**: Trusting (demo, evaluation)
- **Rung 5**: Advocating (decision, commitment)

**Key Elements**:
1. **Observation**: Show you've done homework
2. **Relevance**: Connect to their specific situation
3. **Value**: Offer something useful before asking
4. **Soft Ask**: Match ask to zero trust level

## Sequence 1: The Value Audit Approach

### Email 1: Pure Value, No Ask (Day 1)

**Subject Lines (A/B test)**:
- Quick observation about [Company]'s logistics
- [Company] + freight visibility
- Noticed something about [Company]

```
Hi [Name],

I've been following [Company]'s expansion into [new market/region] -
impressive growth trajectory.

With that kind of scale-up, I imagine your dispatch team is feeling
the pressure. More shipments, more carriers, more tracking calls.

I put together a quick benchmark of what "good" looks like for
[industry] companies at your stage:

→ Tracking calls per 100 shipments: <5 (vs. industry avg of 25+)
→ Invoice reconciliation time: <7 days (vs. 30-45 typical)
→ Real-time visibility: 95%+ (vs. 40-60% typical)

If any of these feel far from where you are, you're not alone.
Most [industry] companies we talk to are in the same boat.

Happy to share how others have closed these gaps if useful.

Best,
[Signature]

P.S. No pitch here—just thought this might be relevant given
what you're building.
```

### Email 2: Social Proof (Day 4)

**Subject**: How [Similar Company] solved the tracking problem

```
Hi [Name],

Following up on my note about logistics benchmarks.

Quick story: [Similar Company in same industry] was doing
500+ tracking calls per day. Their dispatch team was drowning.

Within 90 days, they:
• Eliminated 85% of tracking calls (automated visibility)
• Cut invoice reconciliation from 45 days to 7
• Improved OTIF from 82% to 94%

The CFO said it was the fastest ROI on any ops investment
they'd made.

Not saying your situation is identical—but if any of those
numbers resonate, might be worth a conversation.

Either way, happy to share the full case study if you're curious.

Best,
[Signature]
```

### Email 3: The Insight (Day 8)

**Subject**: Something I noticed about [Company]

```
Hi [Name],

Did a bit more digging on [Company]'s logistics setup
(hope that's not creepy).

Noticed you're moving [product type] across [X locations].
That's typically where companies see the most leakage—
detention at plants, consolidation missed, carrier
accountability gaps.

Based on similar operations, you might be leaving
₹[X-Y]L on the table annually. (Happy to show my math.)

Would a 15-minute call to pressure-test that assumption
be useful? No pitch—just want to see if I'm directionally
right.

If not, no worries at all. I'll stop filling your inbox.

Best,
[Signature]
```

### Email 4: The Breakup (Day 14)

**Subject**: Should I close your file?

```
Hi [Name],

I've reached out a few times about logistics efficiency
at [Company]. Haven't heard back, which usually means
one of three things:

1. Timing is off (totally fair)
2. Not a priority right now (also fair)
3. You're already sorted (great!)

I don't want to be that annoying vendor, so I'll assume
it's not the right time.

If anything changes, I'm here. And if you ever want that
freight cost benchmark, just reply "benchmark" and I'll
send it over.

Wishing you and the team continued success.

Best,
[Signature]

## Sequence 2: The Trigger-Based Approach

Use when you've identified a specific trigger (new plant, expansion, leadership change).

### Email 1: Acknowledge the Trigger (Day 1)

**Subject**: Congrats on [trigger event]

```
Hi [Name],

Saw the news about [Company]'s [new plant / expansion /
acquisition / new role]. Congratulations—that's a big move.

Having helped other [industry] companies through similar
transitions, I know the logistics complexity that comes
with [specific challenge from trigger]:

→ New lanes to optimize
→ Carrier relationships to build
→ Visibility gaps to close

Most companies we work with wish they'd addressed visibility
BEFORE the expansion, not after (when it's firefighting).

If you're thinking about this, happy to share what we've
seen work. No strings attached.

Best,
[Signature]
```

### Email 2: The Relevant Case Study (Day 5)

**Subject**: How [Company] handled [same trigger]

```
Hi [Name],

Since you're going through [trigger event], thought this
might be relevant:

[Similar Company] faced the same challenge when they
[expanded/opened new plant/etc.]. Their logistics costs
were spiraling, and visibility was near zero on new lanes.

What they did:
1. Started with a 5-lane pilot (low risk, quick proof)
2. Proved 20% cost reduction on those lanes
3. Rolled out across all operations in 90 days

The key insight: They got ahead of the problem instead
of waiting until it was a crisis.

Want me to connect you with their logistics head?
They're happy to share lessons learned.

Best,
[Signature]
```

### Email 3: The Specific Value (Day 10)

**Subject**: Quick math on [Company]'s opportunity

```
Hi [Name],

Based on what I know about [Company]—[X] plants,
roughly [Y] daily shipments, [industry] sector—
here's a rough sizing of your opportunity:

If you're like similar companies:
• Freight leakage: 3-5% of spend (detention, poor rates)
• Manual tracking: 30-50 hrs/week across team
• OTIF gaps: 10-15 points below customer expectation

Conservative estimate: ₹[X]L annual improvement potential.

I could be way off—happy to do a proper assessment
(takes about a week, no cost) to get real numbers.

Worth 15 minutes to discuss?

Best,
[Signature]
```

## Sequence 3: The Referral/Warm Intro Approach

Use when you have a connection or referral.

### Email 1: Leverage the Connection (Day 1)

**Subject**: [Mutual Connection] suggested I reach out

```
Hi [Name],

[Mutual Connection] mentioned you might be the right
person to talk to about logistics optimization at [Company].

They said you're dealing with [specific challenge], which
is exactly what we help [industry] companies solve.

Quick context: We helped [Mutual Connection's company]
reduce freight costs by 18% and eliminate 40 hours/week
of manual tracking. They thought you might benefit from
a similar approach.

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to see if there's
a fit? [Mutual Connection] said they're happy to make
an intro if you'd prefer that route.

Best,
[Signature]
```

### Email 2: Add Proof (Day 4)

**Subject**: Re: [Mutual Connection] suggested I reach out

```
Hi [Name],

Following up on my note. Here's a bit more context on
what we did with [Mutual Connection's company]:

Before:
• 45-day invoice reconciliation cycle
• 60% real-time visibility
• 25 tracking calls per 100 shipments

After (within 90 days):
• 7-day reconciliation
• 98% visibility
• 3 tracking calls per 100 shipments

[Mutual Connection] mentioned you're facing similar
challenges. If that's true, might be worth a quick chat.

If not, no worries—just let me know and I'll stop
following up.

Best,
[Signature]
```

## Sequence 4: The Re-Engagement Sequence

Use for leads who went cold after initial engagement.

### Email 1: The Check-In (Day 1)

**Subject**: Still thinking about [topic we discussed]?

```
Hi [Name],

We spoke [X months] ago about [specific topic/challenge].
You mentioned [specific thing they said], but the timing
wasn't right.

Curious if anything has changed on your end?

A few things have changed on ours:
• [New feature/capability relevant to their need]
• [New customer win in their industry]
• [New insight/benchmark]

If the timing is better now, happy to pick up where
we left off. If not, just let me know and I'll check
back in [X months].

Best,
[Signature]
```

### Email 2: The New Proof Point (Day 5)

**Subject**: Thought of you when I saw this

```
Hi [Name],

Remember when we discussed [their specific challenge]?

Just wrapped up a project with [similar company] that
reminded me of your situation:

[1-2 sentence case study with specific result]

Made me think about our conversation. If you're still
dealing with [challenge], this might give you some ideas—
even if Fretron isn't the right fit.

Want me to send over the full case study?

Best,
[Signature]

## Industry-Specific Variations

### Steel/Metals Industry

**Pain Points to Reference**:
- Plant-to-port logistics complexity
- Weight-based billing reconciliation challenges
- Carrier capacity during peak seasons
- Customer penalty clauses (OEMs)

**Subject Line Variations**:
- Freight visibility for steel logistics
- The 3-5% you're probably losing on outbound freight
- How [Steel Company] cut detention costs 40%

**Specific Language**:
```
"With steel, every day of detention is money burned.
We've seen plants lose ₹2-3L per month just on demurrage
that could have been avoided with better visibility."
```

### Cement Industry

**Pain Points to Reference**:
- Multi-plant dispatch coordination
- Seasonal demand spikes
- Dealer/distributor delivery SLAs
- Vehicle turnaround time at plants

**Subject Line Variations**:
- Dispatch efficiency for cement logistics
- How [Cement Company] improved plant TAT by 35%
- The visibility gap in cement distribution

**Specific Language**:
```
"Cement logistics is a timing game. One delayed dispatch
cascades into missed deliveries across multiple dealers.
We help companies get ahead of exceptions before they
become customer complaints."
```

### FMCG/Consumer Goods

**Pain Points to Reference**:
- Distribution network complexity
- Last-mile visibility gaps
- Retailer delivery windows
- Promotional spike handling

**Subject Line Variations**:
- FMCG distribution visibility
- How [FMCG Company] hit 98% OTIF
- Managing freight during promotional peaks

**Specific Language**:
```
"In FMCG, shelf availability is everything. When your
logistics can't keep up with demand signals, you're not
just missing deliveries—you're losing market share."
```

---

## Follow-Up Best Practices

### Timing Rules
- **Email 1 → Email 2**: 3-4 days
- **Email 2 → Email 3**: 4-5 days
- **Email 3 → Email 4**: 5-7 days
- **After breakup**: Re-engage after 60-90 days

### Response Handling

**If they reply positively**:
```
Thanks for getting back to me, [Name].

Would [Day] at [Time] work for a quick call? I'll keep
it to 15 minutes—just want to understand your situation
and see if there's a fit.

[Calendar link]
```

**If they reply with objection**:
```
Appreciate the honesty, [Name].

[Address specific objection briefly]

If that changes, I'm here. In the meantime, I'll add
you to our quarterly insights email—useful benchmarks
and no sales pitch. Sound okay?
```

**If they reply "not now"**:
```
Totally understand, [Name]. Timing matters.

Would it be helpful if I checked back in [specific
timeframe]? Or would you prefer I just leave the door
open and you reach out when ready?

Either way works for me.
```

### Subject Line Best Practices

**Do**:
- Keep under 40 characters
- Reference their company
- Be specific, not generic
- Sound human, not marketing

**Don't**:
- Use ALL CAPS
- Include [BRACKETS] or {variables}
- Start with "RE:" if it's not a reply
- Use clickbait ("You won't believe...")
