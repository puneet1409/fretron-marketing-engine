# Tier-Based Sequence Strategies

Different outreach approaches based on account tier and value.

## Tier Framework Recap

| Tier | Account Count | Value | Personalization Depth | Channels |
|------|---------------|-------|----------------------|----------|
| **Tier 1** | 10-20 | Highest | Individual-level | Multi-channel, multi-threaded |
| **Tier 2** | 50-100 | High | Role-level | Email + LinkedIn |
| **Tier 3** | 200-500 | Good | Company-level | Email primary, scaled |

## Tier 1: Strategic Accounts (10-20)

### Personalization Depth

**Individual-level personalization required:**

```
Generic (❌): "Companies in steel face logistics challenges..."
Company (⚠️): "Noticed [Company] expanding into Western India..."
Individual (✓): "Your LinkedIn post about detention at Rourkela plant
                  resonated—we're seeing the same pattern across steel..."
```

### Research Investment

**Per account (2-3 hours):**
- Read last 20 LinkedIn posts from key contacts
- Review company news (last 6 months)
- Map 5+ contacts with roles and responsibilities
- Identify specific pain indicators
- Find relevant case study with similar company

### Sequence Structure

**Duration:** 12 weeks (integrated with warmup)
**Emails:** 5 emails over weeks 5-12
**LinkedIn:** Continuous engagement throughout
**Multi-threading:** 3-5 contacts engaged

```
Weeks 1-4: LinkedIn Warmup Only
├── Follow 5 contacts
├── Engage with content 2x/week
├── Share relevant content
└── Send connection requests (Week 4)

Weeks 5-8: Email + LinkedIn
├── Email 1: Hyper-personalized insight (Week 5)
├── LinkedIn DM: Value share (Week 6)
├── Email 2: Specific case study (Week 7)
└── Email 3: Question about their approach (Week 8)

Weeks 9-12: Multi-threaded Outreach
├── Email 4: Soft ask to primary (Week 9)
├── LinkedIn outreach to secondary contact (Week 10)
├── Email 5: Breakup or meeting (Week 11)
└── Phone call attempt if signals strong (Week 12)
```

### Email Templates (Tier 1)

**Email 1: Hyper-Personalized Insight**

```
Subject: Your Rourkela detention challenge

Hi [Name],

Read your post about the detention issues at your Rourkela plant—
the 4-hour average TAT you mentioned is actually better than most
steel companies I see (avg is 6+ hours).

But I'm curious about something: Are you tracking detention cost
per shipment or just at the aggregate level? The companies doing
per-shipment tracking are finding 15-20% of their loads account
for 70% of detention cost.

No pitch—just noticed a pattern that might be relevant given
what you shared.

[Signature]

P.S. Happy to share the detention benchmarks we've compiled
across 40+ steel plants if useful.
```

**Email 3: Direct Question**

```
Subject: Quick question about [Company]'s visibility setup

Hi [Name],

One thing I've been wondering since our LinkedIn connection:

How are you handling real-time visibility at [Company] right now?

When I talk to steel logistics heads, it's usually one of:
a) GPS trackers + manual check-ins (works but labor-intensive)
b) Carrier portals (fragmented, never complete)
c) Unified dashboard (rare, but game-changing)
d) Flying blind (more common than people admit)

Genuinely curious which camp [Company] falls into.
No wrong answer—just trying to understand the landscape.

### Multi-Threading Script

**After engaging primary contact, reach out to secondary:**

```
Subject: [Primary Contact] and freight visibility

Hi [Secondary Name],

I've been exchanging notes with [Primary] about logistics
visibility at [Company].

Given your role in [Finance/Operations/IT], I imagine you see
this from a different angle—[cost impact / operational efficiency
/ integration complexity].

Would you be open to a 10-minute call to share your perspective?
Not a sales pitch—just trying to understand how different
stakeholders think about this.

```

## Tier 2: Target Accounts (50-100)

### Personalization Depth

**Role-level personalization:**

```
Generic (❌): "Companies in FMCG face logistics challenges..."
Role-specific (✓): "As Head of Logistics, you're probably dealing
                     with distributor delivery SLAs and seasonal spikes..."
```

### Research Investment

**Per account (30-45 minutes):**
- Scan company website and recent news
- Identify 2-3 key contacts
- Determine industry sub-segment
- Note any obvious triggers
- Match to relevant case study

### Sequence Structure

**Duration:** 4 weeks email sequence (after 2-week warmup)
**Emails:** 5 emails
**LinkedIn:** Connection + light engagement
**Multi-threading:** Optional, based on signals

```
Weeks 1-2: Light Warmup
├── LinkedIn connection to primary
├── 2-3 content engagements
└── Account in advertising

Weeks 3-6: Email Sequence
├── Email 1: Role-relevant insight (Day 0)
├── Email 2: Industry benchmark (Day 4)
├── Email 3: Peer case study (Day 8)
├── Email 4: Question (Day 14)
└── Email 5: Soft ask / breakup (Day 21)
```

### Email Templates (Tier 2)

**Email 1: Role-Relevant Insight**

```
Subject: FMCG distribution visibility

Hi [Name],

As Head of Logistics at [Company], you're likely juggling
distributor SLAs, seasonal demand spikes, and the constant
question: "Where's my truck?"

Quick insight from similar FMCG operations:
→ Average tracking calls per 100 shipments: 25+
→ Companies with real-time visibility: <5 calls
→ Time savings: 30-40 hours/week for dispatch team

The difference? Usually not technology—it's process discipline
on carrier compliance.

Just thought it might be relevant given the season coming up.

**Email 5: Breakup with Value**

```
Subject: Closing the loop

Hi [Name],

I've shared a few insights over the past few weeks.
Haven't heard back—which usually means:

1. Not a priority right now (fair)
2. Already sorted (great!)
3. Wrong person (let me know who)

Either way, I'll stop filling your inbox.

If anything changes, here's a quick resource that might help
when the time is right: [Link to ungated benchmark report]

Best of luck with the upcoming peak season.

## Tier 3: Awareness Accounts (200-500)

### Personalization Depth

**Company-level only:**

```
Generic (still avoid): "Companies face logistics challenges..."
Company-level (✓): "Noticed [Company] is in the [industry] space—
                     here's what we're seeing..."
```

### Research Investment

**Per account (5-10 minutes):**
- Verify company and contact details
- Confirm industry segment
- Basic company size (employee count, locations)
- That's it—this is scaled outreach

### Sequence Structure

**Duration:** 3 weeks
**Emails:** 4 emails (shorter sequence)
**LinkedIn:** Minimal/none
**Personalization:** Template-based with company/industry variables

```
Week 1:
├── Email 1: Industry insight (Day 0)
└── Email 2: Benchmark data (Day 4)

Week 2:
├── Email 3: Brief case study (Day 8)

Week 3:
├── Email 4: Soft ask / breakup (Day 14)
```

### Email Templates (Tier 3)

**Email 1: Scaled Industry Insight**

```
Subject: [Industry] freight benchmarks

Hi [Name],

Quick data point for [Industry] logistics:

→ Average freight cost as % of revenue: [X-Y]%
→ Typical visibility gaps: 40-60% of shipments
→ Hidden cost (detention, reconciliation): 2-5% of spend

Where does [Company] stack up?

If you're above these benchmarks, the usual culprits are
detention and carrier management.

[Signature]
```

**Email 4: Efficient Breakup**

```
Subject: Should I close your file?

Hi [Name],

Reached out a few times—haven't connected.
Assuming timing isn't right.

If freight optimization becomes a priority,
I'm here. Otherwise, I'll stop following up.

Best,
[Signature]
