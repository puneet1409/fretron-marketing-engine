# Writing Cold Outreach Sequences for Fretron

Create outbound sequences that build trust progressively before asking for commitment.

## When to Use This Skill

- Writing cold email sequences for target accounts
- Creating LinkedIn outreach campaigns
- Developing ABM warmup sequences
- Refreshing existing outreach that isn't working
- **Auditing existing SmartLead campaigns** (see `./auditing-existing-campaigns.md`)

## Critical: The "Cold" Fallacy

**Common mistake**: Treating Email 1 as first contact.

**Reality**: For Tier 1-2 accounts, Email 1 should come AFTER 2-4 weeks of warmup (LinkedIn engagement, content exposure). They should already recognize your name.

```
WRONG: Email 1 = First time they hear from you
RIGHT: Email 1 = First direct ask after weeks of ambient familiarity
```

See `./pre-outreach-warmup-integration.md` for the warmup → outreach handoff.

## Tier-Based Approaches

Not all accounts get the same treatment:

| Tier | Accounts | Personalization | Warmup | Sequence |
|------|----------|-----------------|--------|----------|
| **Tier 1** | 10-20 | Individual-level | 4 weeks | 12 weeks, multi-threaded |
| **Tier 2** | 50-100 | Role-level | 2 weeks | 4 weeks |
| **Tier 3** | 200-500 | Company-level | None | 3 weeks, scaled |

See `./tier-based-sequence-strategies.md` for tier-specific templates.

## Trust Philosophy (Core Principle)

**Cold outreach starts at ZERO trust.**

**The Trust Ladder**:
```
Level 0: Unknown → "Who is this?"
Level 1: Noticed → "I've seen them around"
Level 2: Interested → "They seem to know my world"
Level 3: Engaged → "They've helped me already"
Level 4: Trusting → "I'd take a call with them"
Level 5: Advocating → "I'd recommend them"
```

**The Rule**: Your ASK must match current TRUST level.

| Trust Level | Appropriate Ask |
|-------------|-----------------|
| 0 (Unknown) | Nothing. Give value only. |
| 1 (Noticed) | React to content, engage |
| 2 (Interested) | Quick insight, resource |
| 3 (Engaged) | 10-min conversation |
| 4 (Trusting) | Demo, audit |
| 5 (Advocating) | Pilot, referral |

## The Trust Letter Framework

**Traditional cold email**: "Hi, I'm from Fretron, we do X, want a demo?"
**Trust letter approach**: "Hi, I noticed [specific thing]. Here's something valuable for you. No ask."

### Trust Letter Structure

**Email 1: Pure Value (No Ask)**
```
Subject: [Specific observation about their business]

Hi [Name],

[1 sentence showing you researched them]

I put together [specific valuable thing]:
- [Insight 1 relevant to them]
- [Insight 2 relevant to them]
- [Insight 3 relevant to them]

[Link to resource if applicable]

No pitch, just thought this might be useful given [specific context].

[Signature]
```

**Email 2: More Value + Soft Bridge**
```
Subject: Re: [Previous subject]

Hi [Name],

Following up on [previous value].

Here's another quick insight: [specific observation about their industry/situation]

[1-2 sentences of value]

If this resonates, happy to share how others in [their industry] are tackling this.

[Signature]
```

**Email 3: Value + Gentle Ask**
```
Subject: Quick question about [specific topic]

Hi [Name],

One more thought on [topic]:

[Brief insight]

I've been helping [similar company type] with [specific outcome].

Would a 10-minute call to swap notes make sense? No pitch, just curious if our approaches align.

[Signature]
```

## Sequence Templates

### Sequence 1: The Insight Sequence (5 emails, 3 weeks)

**Email 1 (Day 0): Industry Insight**
```
Subject: Quick insight on [their industry] freight costs

Hi [Name],

Noticed [Company] is expanding into [region/product line] — congrats.

Quick insight from working with similar [industry] companies:
The top 3 freight cost leaks we see are:
1. LTL shipments that should be consolidated
2. Detention at plants (avg ₹2-3L/month hidden cost)
3. Spot buying without competitive bidding

Just thought it might be relevant as you scale.

No ask — just sharing what we're seeing.

Best,
[Signature]
```

**Email 2 (Day 4): Benchmark Data**
```
Subject: [Industry] freight benchmarks

Hi [Name],

Following up with some data you might find useful:

Average freight cost as % of revenue:
- Steel/Metals: 6-9%
- FMCG: 4-6%
- Auto components: 5-7%

Where do you stack up?

If you're above these, the usual culprits are detention and poor load optimization.

Happy to share the full benchmark report if helpful.

[Signature]
```

**Email 3 (Day 8): Competitor/Peer Insight**
```
Subject: What [similar company] is doing differently

Hi [Name],

Not sure if you've seen this, but [similar company type] in [region] recently:
- Reduced freight costs 12% in 6 months
- Cut detention by 40%
- Went from 15 Excel sheets to one dashboard

The common thread? Visibility and process discipline.

Curious if this matches what you're seeing at [Company]?

[Signature]
```

**Email 4 (Day 12): Quick Question**
```
Subject: Quick question

Hi [Name],

Simple question:

How are you tracking cost-per-lane at [Company] today?

Most logistics heads I talk to either:
a) Pull it manually from invoices (painful)
b) Don't track it at all (flying blind)
c) Have real-time visibility (rare but powerful)

Curious which camp you're in.

[Signature]
```

**Email 5 (Day 18): The Soft Ask**
```
Subject: Worth 10 minutes?

Hi [Name],

I've shared a few insights over the past few weeks. If any of it resonated, I'd love to hear how you're thinking about freight optimization at [Company].

Not a sales pitch — genuinely curious how [industry] companies are approaching this.

10 minutes next week?

If not the right time, no worries. I'll keep sharing insights when I see relevant ones.

## LinkedIn Outreach Sequence

### Before Connecting

1. **Engage with their content** (like, comment — genuine, not salesy)
2. **Share content they'd find valuable** (tag if appropriate)
3. **Build familiarity** before connection request

### Connection Request (Trust Level 1)

```
Hi [Name], I've been following your posts on [topic]. Your take on [specific insight] resonated. Would love to connect and learn more about what you're seeing in [industry] logistics.
```

**NOT**: "Hi, I'm from Fretron, we help companies like yours..."

### After Connection (Trust Level 2)

**Message 1 (Day 2): Value, No Ask**
```
Thanks for connecting, [Name].

Always curious how [industry] logistics leaders are thinking about this.
```

```

```

## Measuring Outreach Effectiveness

| Metric | Target | What It Tells You |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Open Rate | 40-60% | Subject lines, timing |
| Reply Rate | 10-20% | Value resonance, relevance |
| Positive Reply Rate | 5-10% | Trust building working |
| Meeting Book Rate | 3-5% | Sequence effectiveness |

**If reply rate < 5%**: You're asking too much too soon. Add more value earlier.

## Trust-Building Checklist

Before sending any outreach:

- [ ] Does Email 1 provide value with NO ask?
- [ ] Is the ask proportional to trust level?
- [ ] Is there specific research showing I know their world?
- [ ] Would I reply to this if I received it?
- [ ] Am I building credibility before asking for time?
- [ ] Is the tone helpful, not salesy?

## What NOT to Do

**Trust Destroyers**:
- "I know you're busy, but..." (starts with apology)
- "We're the leading..." (self-promotion)
- "15 minutes to learn how we can help?" (ask before value)
- "Just checking in" (no value)
- "Circling back" (annoying)
- Generic compliments ("Love what you're doing at [Company]")

**Build trust first. The meeting will follow.**

## Fluint's Forward-Worthy Communication

From Fluint Sales 2.0 and Nate Nasralla's **"Selling With"** (2023): Create content that champions are proud to forward internally.

> "Think of yourself as a writer—your words travel and influence when you're absent."
> — Nate Nasralla

**The Writer Mindset**: Every email may be forwarded. Your champion quotes you in internal meetings. Written clarity beats verbal persuasion.

### Forward-Worthy Principles

**Characteristics of Forward-Worthy Emails:**
- **Concise**: Scannable, not walls of text
- **Customer-language**: Uses their terminology, not vendor-speak
- **Internal ammunition**: Makes their argument stronger
- **Easy to share**: Can be forwarded without explanation
- **Positioning**: Makes the champion look strategic

### Applying Forward-Worthy to Cold Outreach

| Traditional Email | Forward-Worthy Email |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| "Our TMS solution offers..." | "Here's how [industry] companies are solving..." |
| Long paragraphs | Bullet points, scannable |
| Vendor-centric | Customer-problem-centric |
| Generic insights | Specific, actionable data |
| Asks for meeting | Provides value they can use |

**Test**: Would the recipient forward this to their boss? If not, rewrite it.
