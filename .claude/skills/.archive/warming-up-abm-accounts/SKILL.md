# Warming Up ABM Accounts for Fretron

Build familiarity and trust with target accounts through coordinated warmup before direct sales outreach.

## When to Use This Skill

- Starting ABM engagement with new target accounts
- Planning 30-60-90 day warmup campaigns
- Coordinating LinkedIn, email, and content touches
- Moving accounts from "cold" to "warm" for sales handoff

## Trust Philosophy Integration

**ABM warmup is trust-building at scale.**

**The Warmup Goal**: Move accounts from "Never Heard of Fretron" to "I've seen them, they seem to know our industry."

```
Week 1-4:   Visibility (they see us)
Week 5-8:   Familiarity (they recognize us)
Week 9-12:  Interest (they engage with us)
Week 13+:   Ready for conversation
```

**Key Principle**: Warmup is NOT about selling. It's about earning the right to have a conversation later.

## Full Funnel ABM Framework

### Full Funnel vs Traditional ABM

| Full Funnel Approach | Traditional ABM Pitfalls |
|---------------------|--------------------------|
| Practical, actionable playbooks | Over-reliance on technology |
| Ready-to-use templates | Generic "personalization" |
| Real campaign examples | Broad ads without relationships |
| Revenue focus, not vanity metrics | Focus on engagement metrics |
| Personalization at scale | Lack of sales alignment |
| 1-to-1 engagement emphasis | Volume-based approaches |

**Key Differentiator**: Full Funnel emphasizes meaningful, substantive interactions that help target accounts solve real business problems—not just impressions.

### Account Tiers

**Tier 1 (Strategic)**: 10-20 accounts
- Highest fit and value
- Multi-threaded engagement (5+ contacts)
- Personalized 1:1 content
- Direct outreach after warmup

**Tier 2 (Target)**: 50-100 accounts
- High fit
- Key persona engagement (2-3 contacts)
- Semi-personalized content
- SDR outreach after warmup

**Tier 3 (Awareness)**: 200-500 accounts
- Good fit
- Single persona touch
- Programmatic/scaled content
- Marketing nurture

## Warmup Touches by Channel

### LinkedIn Warmup Sequence

**Week 1-2**: Passive observation
- Follow key contacts
- Study their content, interests, challenges

- Comment with insight (not "Great post!")
- Share content they'd find valuable

**Week 5-6**: Connection
- Send connection request with context
- NOT: "I'd like to add you to my network"
- YES: "Your post on [topic] resonated. Would love to connect."

- No ask yet

**Week 9-12**: Conversation
- Ask a genuine question
- Reference previous engagement
- Soft ask for conversation if signals are positive

### Email Warmup Sequence

See `writing-cold-outreach-sequences` skill for detailed templates.

**Week 4**: First email (industry insight, no ask)

**Week 7**: Third email (peer example)
**Week 9**: Fourth email (question)
**Week 11**: Fifth email (soft ask)

### Content/Advertising Warmup

**Week 1-4**: Awareness ads
- Brand awareness objective
- Industry-relevant thought leadership
- NOT product/demo focused

**Week 5-8**: Engagement ads
- Case studies, guides, reports
- Gated or ungated based on value
- Pixel for remarketing

**Week 9-12**: Conversion ads
- Demo/consultation offer
- Only to engaged accounts
- Retarget website visitors

## Multi-Threading Strategy

From Nate Nasralla's **"Selling With"**: Build minimally viable committees—just enough people to confirm problems, create use cases, and clear contracts. Expanding committees signal dysfunction.

> "Champions are the glue between daily users, key stakeholders (security, legal, IT, procurement), and decision-makers."
> — Nate Nasralla

**For each Tier 1 account, engage:**

| Persona | Role | Engagement Focus |
|---------|------|------------------|
| Champion | Logistics Head | Deep engagement, primary target |
| Influencer | CFO/Finance | ROI, cost savings content |
| User | Dispatch Team | Day-to-day pain content |
| Technical | IT/CIO | Integration, security content |
| Blocker | Procurement | Competitor comparison, pricing |

**Multi-threading sequence:**
1. Start with likely champion (Logistics Head)
2. After engagement, reach out to Influencer
3. Reference conversations across contacts
4. Build coalition before demo request

## Warmup Metrics & Signals

### Engagement Signals (Positive)

- LinkedIn connection accepted
- Content downloaded
- Website visited (multiple times)

## AI-Enabled ABM (Kyle Poyar / Growth Unhinged)

### ABM to ABX Evolution
Modern account-based strategy has shifted from ABM (marketing-owned) to **ABX (Account-Based Experience)** - unified across sales, marketing, and product.

### Multi-Signal Approach
Leverage diverse signals beyond firmographics:
- **Product usage data**: How users interact with your product
- **Intent signals**: Webinar attendance, email engagement, website activity
- **Growth signals**: Job postings, funding, headcount changes
- **Technographic data**: Software stack they currently use

### AI Applications in ABM Warmup

| Task | AI Tool | Application |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Account research | Deep Research (ChatGPT) | Automated company intelligence |
| Content personalization | Custom GPTs | Industry-specific messaging |
| Engagement monitoring | AI agents | Track LinkedIn interactions |
| Intent detection | Clay + signals | Identify ready-to-buy accounts |

### 2025 GTM Stats (Growth Unhinged)
- **Outbound & ABM** represents 20% of top growth tactics
- Intent-based outbound (49%) is the fastest-growing experiment
- **Clay** is the most anticipated tool for expansion
- AI is best suited for **top and middle of funnel** efforts

**Key Insight**: Reserve humans for later-stage deal work. Use AI for research, personalization, and monitoring.

## Account Mapping ("Selling With" Framework)

From Nate Nasralla: Create dynamic maps showing information flow—who must communicate what, to whom, when.

**Three-Bullet Contact Profile:**
```
Contact: [Name], [Title]
1. Buying Role: [Champion/Economic Buyer/Evaluator/User]
2. Current Priority: [What keeps them up at night]
3. Key Metrics: [What they're measured on]
```

**Information Flow Questions:**
- Who must communicate what, to whom, when?
- What are existing communication channels (standing meetings, Slack, Teams)?
- Who influences whom in this organization?
- Where are silent or fading contacts (potential blockers)?
