# Retargeting Paid Search Traffic with LinkedIn Ads

Use LinkedIn as an **ecosystem ROI enhancer** - not a separate experiment, but a strategic deployment to protect and multiply existing paid search investments.

## The Core Insight

**If you spend ₹8L+/month ($10k+) on Google Ads without structured LinkedIn retargeting, you're leaving money on the table. Every. Single. Time.**

Why? LinkedIn is the ONLY native ads channel that can:
1. See ALL website traffic
2. Layer qualifying ICP filters on top of warm traffic
3. Reveal actual company names engaging with your ads
4. Nurture the buying committee (not just the clicker)

## Why This Works

### The Google Ads Problem

Google clicks are judged on a single first impression:
- Large competitors win with bigger creative budgets
- Polished landing pages from enterprise players
- ~2% conversion rate on first visit
- You're competing against 3-4 alternatives they're evaluating

### The LinkedIn Solution

Signal-based retargeting changes the evaluation:
- Multiple exposures across buying committee (not one shot)
- Spend only on warm, ICP-fit visitors (not anonymous majority)
- Improve probability of winning even if first visit was to competitor
- Takes pressure off landing page converting on first visit

**Net effect**: Higher downstream conversion, better win rates, lower cost per closed deal.

## The Signal-Based Framework

### Step 1: Setup Base Audiences

Create time-bound audience windows:

| Audience | Window | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Website visitors | 30 day | Hot traffic |
| Website visitors | 60 day | Warm traffic |
| Website visitors | 90 day | Nurture pool |
| Website visitors | 180 day | Extended nurture |
| Company page visitors | 30/60/90/180 day | Brand-aware |
| Google-UTM matched | All windows | Isolate paid search traffic |

**LinkedIn Insight Tag**: Must be installed site-wide before starting.

### Step 2: Qualify Website Traffic

Don't retarget everyone. Layer LinkedIn's native targeting filters:

**ICP Filters to Apply:**
- Company size: 200-5000 employees (Fretron sweet spot)
- Seniority: VP, Director, CXO, Manager
- Industry: Manufacturing, Metals & Mining, Building Materials, FMCG
- Job function: Operations, Supply Chain, Logistics, Purchasing
- Saved account lists: Tier 1-2 ABM accounts

**Optional**: Create Google-UTM matched audience to isolate ONLY paid search traffic (vs organic, direct, etc.)

### Step 3: 90-Day Nurture Campaign

**Goal**: Build trust and committee coverage over 90 days.

**Content Rotation**:

| Week | Content Type | Format | CTA |
|------|--------------|--------|-----|
| 1-2 | Thought leader posts | Sponsored content | None (awareness) |
| 3-4 | Case study (industry-matched) | Single image | Learn more |
| 5-6 | Testimonial clip | Video (30 sec) | Watch more |
| 7-8 | Educational asset | Document ad | Download |
| 9-10 | Demo clip / Product tour | Video | See demo |
| 11-12 | Customer results | Carousel | Get case study |

**Target**: 3+ impressions per account across multiple titles.

**Budget**: 10-30% of Google spend (if Google is ₹10L, LinkedIn is ₹1-3L)

### Step 4: Engagement Threshold Triggers

Define what "engaged" means:
- Clicked MoFU campaign
- Watched 75%+ of retargeting video
- Downloaded content asset
- Visited pricing/demo page (via UTM)

**Create matched audience from engagers** → These are your signal-qualified leads.

### Step 5: 30-Day BoFU Campaign

**For engaged cohort only**, run aggressive CTAs:

| Creative | CTA | Offer |
|----------|-----|-------|
| ROI calculator | Calculate savings | Freight cost analysis |
| Competitive comparison | See how we compare | vs SAP/Oracle breakdown |
| Demo clip | Book demo | 20-min personalized walkthrough |
| Pricing conversation | Talk to sales | No-pressure pricing discussion |

**This campaign is time-bound** (30 days) and signal-based (only engagers).

## The ROI Math (CFO-Friendly)

### Baseline: Google Only

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Google clicks | 5,000 |
| CPC | ₹500 ($6) |
| Google spend | ₹25L ($30k) |
| Conversion rate | 2% |
| Leads | 100 |
| Win rate | 10% |
| Deals | 10 |
| Avg deal size | ₹25L ($30k) |
| Revenue | ₹2.5Cr ($300k) |
| CAC | ₹2.5L ($3k) |

### With LinkedIn Retargeting (Warming Top 20%)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| LinkedIn spend | ₹8L ($10k) targeting 1,000 of 5,000 clicks |
| Warmed conversion rate | 6% (4% lift) |
| Warmed leads | 60 (from 1,000 warmed) |
| Cold leads | 80 (from 4,000 unwarmed) |
| Total leads | 140 |
| Win rate | 10% |
| Warmed deals | 6 |
| Cold deals | 8 |
| Total deals | 14 |
| Revenue | ₹3.5Cr ($420k) |
| Total spend | ₹33L ($40k) |
| CAC | ₹2.4L ($2.8k) |
| **Incremental LinkedIn return** | **~15x** |

**Conservative assumption**: Only 4% conversion lift on warmed traffic. Real results often higher.

## Proving ROI: Leadership Scorecard

### Metric 1: Google Ads Cost Per Conversion

**What to track**: CPL on Google should DROP as LinkedIn retargeting starts working.

**Why**: Google takes credit for conversions that LinkedIn influenced (last-click attribution). This is a feature, not a bug - it means the strategy is working.

### Metric 2: Cost Per QUALITY Lead

**What to track**: Cost per qualified demo/meeting (not just any demo).

**Why**: LinkedIn qualifies traffic to ICP-fit accounts. Quality should increase even if volume stays same.

**Setup**: Define qualification criteria, track separately.

### Metric 3: LinkedIn Influenced Conversions + Deals

**Three ways to prove influence:**

**A. LinkedIn Campaign Manager Tracking**
- Setup conversion events (demo request, form fill)
- Both LinkedIn and Google will claim credit
- Useful for platform learning signals

**B. LinkedIn Company Hub**
- See named accounts in retargeting audiences
- Track impressions delivered per account
- Show committee coverage (multiple titles reached)

**C. CRM Pipeline Influence**
- Tools like DemandSense sync with CRM
- Automated lookup of pipeline accounts
- Shows exposure/engagement before opportunity
- Enables velocity, close rate, deal size analysis

## Key Insight

**The retargeting strategy is both diagnostic AND prescriptive**: You measure committee coverage AND fix it across channels.

LinkedIn doesn't replace Google. It MULTIPLIES Google by:
1. Qualifying anonymous traffic to named ICP accounts
2. Extending single touches to committee-wide coverage
3. Converting one-shot landing page visits to 90-day trust-building
4. Moving signal-qualified leads to aggressive conversion asks

**When to scale**: Once you've proven the model (2-3 months), increase LinkedIn budget proportionally with Google. The ROI compounds.
