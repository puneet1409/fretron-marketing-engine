## Common ABM Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: All Channels, No Coordination
**Problem**: Each channel works independently
**Fix**: Weekly coordination meeting, shared account view

### Pitfall 2: Marketing-Only ABM
**Problem**: Sales not involved until handoff
**Fix**: Sales participates in account selection, provides intel

### Pitfall 3: Too Many Accounts
**Problem**: Can't give enough attention to each
**Fix**: Reduce list, increase depth

### Pitfall 4: Measuring Only Conversions
**Problem**: Miss early-stage progress
**Fix**: Track engagement and trust metrics

### Pitfall 5: Generic "Personalization"
**Problem**: {{FirstName}} isn't personalization
**Fix**: Account-specific insights, relevant content
