```

### Sequencing Rules

**Rule 1: Advertising First**
```
Ads begin 2 weeks before outbound
Purpose: Create familiarity before cold outreach
Validation: "You may have seen us on LinkedIn..."
```

**Rule 2: Multi-Channel Coordination**
```
Same week touchpoints across channels:
- Monday: Email
- Tuesday: LinkedIn engagement
- Wednesday: Ad impressions high
- Thursday: Phone attempt
- Friday: Social engagement

Never: All channels on same day (overwhelming)
```

**Rule 3: Engagement-Based Escalation**
```
Trigger: Multiple engagement signals
Action: Accelerate sequence, add channels
Example: Email open + site visit → Same-day phone call
```

**Rule 4: Non-Response Handling**
```
After 4 touches with no response:
- Reduce frequency (not stop)
- Try different personas at account
- Change message angle
- Consider different timing
```
