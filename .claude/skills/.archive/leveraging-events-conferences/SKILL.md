# Leveraging Events & Conferences for Fretron

Turn events into high-leverage pipeline and trust-building opportunities.

## When to Use This Skill

- Selecting which events to attend/sponsor
- Planning pre-event outreach campaigns
- Executing on-site meeting strategy
- Hosting webinars with industry experts
- Organizing customer dinners or roundtables
- Post-event follow-up and conversion

## Why Events Matter

**Key Insight**: Events are the highest-leverage channel per 2025 State of B2B GTM report.

**Why Events Work**:
- Face-to-face builds trust faster than any digital channel
- Concentrated audience of potential buyers
- Borrowed credibility from event/speaker association
- Multiple touchpoints in compressed time

**Event ROI Formula**:
```
(Meetings × Conversion Rate × Deal Size) - Event Cost = ROI
```

## Trust Philosophy Integration

**Events accelerate trust through:**
- **Presence**: Physical meetings build rapport faster
- **Context**: Industry events = shared relevance
- **Association**: Speaking/sponsoring = borrowed credibility
- **Reciprocity**: Hosting = value delivered before ask

**Principle**: Use events to compress the trust-building journey, not skip it.
