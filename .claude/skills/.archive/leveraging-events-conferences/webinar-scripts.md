## Presentation Scripts

### Educational Webinar Script (45 min)

**OPENING (5 minutes)**

```
[SLIDE 1: Title]

HOST:
"Welcome everyone to [Webinar Title]. We'll get started in
just a moment while more people join.

[Wait 1-2 minutes]

Alright, let's dive in! I'm [Name], [Title] at Fretron, and
I'm excited to have you here today.

Quick housekeeping:
- We'll run about 45 minutes with Q&A at the end
- Use the Q&A box for questions—we'll get to as many as we can
- This is being recorded, so if you need to drop off, you'll
  get the recording tomorrow

[SLIDE 2: Agenda]

Here's what we'll cover today:
1. [Topic 1] - The problem most companies face
2. [Topic 2] - What separates top performers
3. [Topic 3] - Practical steps you can take
4. Q&A - Your questions answered

Let's get into it."
```

**SECTION 1: The Problem (10 minutes)**

```
[SLIDE 3: Problem Statement]

HOST:
"Let me start with a question: How many of you are currently
managing logistics with Excel spreadsheets?

[Pause, acknowledge poll/chat]

You're not alone. 70% of mid-market manufacturers in India
still rely on Excel and phone calls for logistics tracking.

Here's the problem with that...

[SLIDE 4: The Hidden Costs]

Most companies think Excel is 'free.' But when we dig into
the actual costs, here's what we find:

1. Tracking calls: Your team makes 300-500 calls a day just
   to know where shipments are. That's 3-4 FTEs just on tracking.

2. Reconciliation delays: 45+ days to close out freight invoices.
   That's working capital sitting idle.

3. Missed optimization: You can't optimize what you can't measure.
   Rate leakage, detention, carrier performance—all invisible.

[SLIDE 5: The Real Impact]

Let me give you a real example...

[Share anonymous customer story with specific numbers]"
```

**SECTION 2: What Top Performers Do (15 minutes)**

```
[SLIDE 6: The Difference]

HOST:
"So what do companies that have solved this do differently?

We studied our top-performing customers and found three things
they all have in common:

[SLIDE 7: Factor 1]

First: Real-time visibility—not end-of-day updates.

[Explain with example, show what this looks like]

[SLIDE 8: Factor 2]

Second: Exception-based management.

Instead of tracking every shipment, they only focus on
problems. The system handles the routine.

[SLIDE 9: Factor 3]

Third: Data-driven carrier management.

They know exactly how each carrier performs. Rate compliance,
on-time delivery, detention—all tracked automatically.

[Share proof point or customer example]"
```

**SECTION 3: How to Get There (10 minutes)**

```
[SLIDE 10: The Path Forward]

HOST:
"So how do you actually make this shift? Here's a practical
roadmap:

[SLIDE 11: Step 1]

Step 1: Audit your current state.
- How many tracking calls per day?
- What's your reconciliation cycle time?
- What's your actual OTIF?

If you don't know these numbers, that's your first problem.

[SLIDE 12: Step 2]

Step 2: Calculate the real cost.
[Walk through calculation framework]

[SLIDE 13: Step 3]

Step 3: Evaluate modern TMS options.
[High-level criteria, not product pitch]

[SLIDE 14: What We've Seen Work]

Now, I'll briefly share what we've seen work at Fretron, but
the principles apply regardless of what solution you choose...

[2-3 minutes on Fretron approach—soft pitch, not hard sell]"
```

**Q&A (10 minutes)**

```
[SLIDE 15: Q&A]

HOST:
"Let's open it up for questions. I see we have quite a few
in the Q&A box.

[Answer 4-6 questions]

For questions we don't get to, I'll follow up by email.

[SLIDE 16: Resources]

Before we wrap up, here are some resources:
- [Lead magnet related to topic]
- [Case study if relevant]
- [Demo signup for those interested]

[SLIDE 17: Thank You]

Thanks everyone for joining! You'll get the recording and
slides tomorrow. Have a great rest of your day."
