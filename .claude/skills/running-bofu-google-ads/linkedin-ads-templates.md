**Story Hook**:
```
"We used to make 500 tracking calls a day.
Now we make 50."

That's what the logistics head at a steel manufacturer
told us 6 months after implementing Fretron.
```

**Statistic Hook**:
```
85% of logistics teams spend more time tracking
shipments than optimizing operations.

What if you could flip that ratio?
```

**Question Hook**:
```
How much time does your team spend on tracking calls?

Multiply that by their hourly cost. That's what
"free" Excel tracking actually costs you.
```

**Comparison Hook**:
```
SAP TM: 12-18 months to implement.
Fretron: 6-8 weeks.

Same visibility. Fraction of the time.
```
