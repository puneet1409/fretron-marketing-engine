# Running BoFU Google Ads

**Depends on**: `trust-building-principles`

## Core Insight

**BoFU searchers have high intent but variable trust. Match landing page ask to implied trust level, not just intent level.**

| Keyword Type | Implied Trust | Landing Page |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| "[Your brand] pricing" | High (brand aware) | Direct demo CTA |
| "[Category] software" | Medium (category aware) | Demo or comparison |
| "[Competitor] alternative" | Low (knows competitor) | Comparison page, proof first |

## Campaign Structure (4-Campaign Model)

### Campaign 1: Brand + High Intent (50% budget)
- Brand keywords, category keywords
- Maximize Conversions bid strategy
- Direct demo landing page
- Expected CVR: 5-8%

### Campaign 2: Competitor Conquest (20% budget)
- "[Competitor] alternative", "[Competitor] vs"
- Target CPA bid strategy
- Comparison landing page (build trust first)
- Expected CVR: 3-5%

**Ad approach**: Don't bash competitors. Lead with differentiation: speed, pricing model, implementation time.

### Campaign 3: Problem-Aware (20% budget)
- Pain point keywords: "reduce [cost]", "improve [metric]"
- Maximize Clicks bid strategy
- Calculator or guide (low-ask, build trust)
- Expected CVR: 8-15% for email capture

### Campaign 4: Remarketing (10% budget)
- Website visitors, demo no-shows, calculator users
- Target ROAS bid strategy
- Social proof creative, urgency

## Keyword Categories

**High-intent**: [category] software, [category] platform, enterprise [category]

**Competitor**: [competitor] alternative, [competitor] pricing, [competitor] vs

**Problem-aware**: reduce [pain], improve [metric], [challenge] solution

**Negative keywords**: free, open source, jobs, careers, tutorial, course, training

## Landing Page Trust Match

| Traffic Source | Trust Level | Page Type |
|----------------|-------------|-----------|
| Brand search | High | Demo request, minimal friction |
| Category search | Medium | Benefits + demo, social proof visible |
| Competitor search | Low | Comparison, proof first, then CTA |
| Problem search | Low | Value content, email capture |

## Optimization Cadence

**Weekly**: Search terms report, add negatives, pause underperformers (CTR < 2%)

**Monthly**: A/B test ad copy, review landing page CVR by campaign, adjust budget by ROAS

**Quarterly**: Full keyword refresh, competitor campaign review, attribution model check

## Metrics & Targets

| Metric | Target | If Below Target |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| CTR | 3%+ | Improve ad copy, check keyword relevance |
| CVR | 3-5% | Optimize landing page, check trust match |
| Quality Score | 7+ | Improve landing page, ad relevance |
| ROAS | 5x+ | Review targeting, landing pages |

## Cross-Channel Synergy: LinkedIn Retargeting

**Critical insight**: Google clicks are single impressions. LinkedIn extends to 90-day trust-building with buying committee.

```
Google drives in-market searches
→ LinkedIn qualifies to ICP (company size, seniority)
→ LinkedIn nurtures with content sequence
→ Higher conversion on warmed traffic
```

**Typical result**: 2x conversion rate on Google traffic when combined with LinkedIn retargeting.

See `linkedin-organic-and-paid` for signal-based retargeting framework.
