# Running BoFU Google Ads for Fretron

Capture high-intent buyers actively searching for TMS solutions through targeted paid search.

## When to Use This Skill

- Planning Google Ads campaigns for demo generation
- Targeting competitor keywords (SAP TMS, Oracle TMS, etc.)
- Optimizing existing campaigns for better ROAS
- Writing ad copy for high-intent keywords
- Allocating budget across campaign types

## Trust Philosophy Integration

**BoFU searchers have HIGH buying intent but VARIABLE trust.**

| Keyword Type | Implied Trust | Appropriate Ask |
|--------------|---------------|-----------------|
| "Fretron pricing" | High (brand aware) | Direct demo CTA |
| "TMS software India" | Medium (category aware) | Demo or comparison content |
| "SAP TMS alternative" | Low (knows competitor) | Comparison page, proof first |

**Rule**: Match landing page ask to implied trust level, not just intent level.

## Integration with Trust Philosophy

**Before launching any campaign, ask:**

1. What trust level does this keyword imply?
2. Does our landing page ask match that trust level?
3. Are we providing value before asking for commitment?

**If trust is low (competitor searchers):**
- Lead with comparison content, not demo
- Offer proof (case studies, ROI data)
- Use remarketing to build trust over time

**If trust is high (brand searchers):**
- Direct demo ask is appropriate
- Reduce friction, minimize form fields
- Fast response SLA (<4 hours)

## Cross-Channel Integration: LinkedIn Retargeting

**Critical Insight**: If you spend ₹8L+/month on Google Ads without LinkedIn retargeting, you're leaving money on the table.

**Why**: Google clicks are judged on single first impression. LinkedIn lets you:
- Qualify anonymous traffic to named ICP accounts
- Extend single touches to committee-wide coverage
- Convert one-shot visits to 90-day trust-building
- Achieve 15-36x return on incremental LinkedIn spend

**See**: → `retargeting-paid-search-with-linkedin` for the full signal-based framework

**Quick math**:
- Google only: ₹25L spend → 10 deals → ₹2.5Cr revenue
- With LinkedIn (₹8L): ₹33L total → 14+ deals → ₹3.5Cr+ revenue
- LinkedIn incremental return: ~15x
