# Fretron Value Propositions

Core messaging frameworks and value statements for all marketing and sales activities.

## Master Value Proposition

### One-Liner
**"Move-as-One: The dispatch command center that turns logistics chaos into competitive advantage."**

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
```
Fretron is a cloud-based TMS built specifically for Indian
manufacturing companies. We help logistics teams eliminate
the Excel spreadsheets and endless tracking calls by providing
real-time visibility across all shipments.

Our customers typically see 15-25% freight cost reduction,
85% fewer tracking calls, and significant OTIF improvements—
usually within the first 90 days.

Unlike global TMS platforms that take 12+ months to implement,
we go live in 6-8 weeks with a transaction-based pricing model.
```

### Full Value Proposition
```
For mid-market Indian manufacturing companies with 50-500 daily
shipments who are struggling with logistics visibility and freight
cost control, Fretron is a cloud-based Transportation Management
System that delivers real-time visibility, automated freight
reconciliation, and intelligent load optimization.

Unlike legacy TMS solutions that require 12+ months to implement
and significant IT resources, Fretron is purpose-built for Indian
manufacturing with 6-8 week implementation, transaction-based
pricing, and local support.

## Objection Handling

### "We're too small for a TMS"

**Response**:
```
"That's actually why we built Fretron the way we did. Traditional
TMS platforms are designed for giant enterprises—and priced that way.

Fretron is transaction-based, so you pay for what you use. Companies
with 50 shipments a day get the same capability as companies with 500.

The question isn't 'are we big enough?' It's 'are we losing enough
to inefficiency that it's worth fixing?' Based on what you've shared,
that seems like a yes."
```

### "We've tried logistics technology before—it didn't work"

**Response**:
```
"I hear that a lot. Can I ask what happened?

[Listen]

That makes sense. Here's why this might be different:

1. Implementation: We go live in 6-8 weeks, not 12 months
2. Adoption: We focus on the dispatch team, not IT
3. Proof: We start with a pilot—prove value before full commitment

If it doesn't work, you'll know in 90 days. No multi-year commitment."
```

### "Now isn't the right time"

**Response**:
```
"Totally understand. Before we close this out, I'm curious—what
would make it the right time?

[Listen for triggers]

That's helpful to know. In the meantime, would it be useful if I
sent you [relevant content] so you have it when the timing is right?

And if [trigger they mentioned] happens, feel free to reach out—I'll
make sure we can move quickly."
```

### "We need to think about it / discuss internally"

**Response**:
```
"Of course. To help that conversation, would it be useful if I:

1. Sent a brief summary of what we discussed?
2. Included some data for your CFO/leadership?
3. Joined a call with whoever else needs to be involved?

I want to make sure they have the same context you do."
```
