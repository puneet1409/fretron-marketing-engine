# Fretron Trust Philosophy

**The core principle governing all marketing and sales activities.**

## The Trust Principle

> **"The ask must match the trust level you have established. To establish trust, offer something of value, relevance, and credibility matching your current trust level, then progressively build."**

## Key Concepts

### 1. Two Independent Variables

**Buying Journey Stage** and **Trust Level** are separate:

```
                    TRUST LEVEL
                    Low    Medium   High
                  ┌──────┬────────┬──────┐
BUYING   Early    │Common│ Some   │ Rare │
JOURNEY  Middle   │ Many │ Common │ Some │
         Late     │Risky │ Tricky │ Best │
                  └──────┴────────┴──────┘
```

- **Late Journey + Low Trust** = Hard sell, high churn risk
- **Late Journey + High Trust** = Easy conversion, sticky customer
- **Early Journey + High Trust** = Long-term opportunity
- **Early Journey + Low Trust** = Standard nurture path

### 2. Trust Levels

| Level | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 0 | Unknown | Never heard of you |
| 1 | Aware | Seen your name |
| 2 | Interested | Engaged with content |
| 3 | Engaged | Active interaction |
| 4 | Trusting | Ready for commitment |
| 5 | Advocating | Would recommend |

### 3. Trust-Appropriate Asks

| Trust Level | Appropriate Ask | Never Ask |
|-------------|-----------------|-----------|
| 0 | Nothing (give value) | Anything |
| 1 | Light content | Demo, email |
| 2 | Gated content | Demo, meeting |
| 3 | 10-min conversation | Full demo |
| 4 | Demo, audit | Pilot, contract |
| 5 | Referral, pilot | N/A |

### 4. Trust Building Ingredients

**Value**: Give before you ask
**Relevance**: Show you understand their world
**Credibility**: Prove you can deliver

### 5. Progressive Trust Building

Each interaction should:
1. Match current trust level
2. Deliver value at that level
3. Earn permission for next level
4. Never skip levels

### The Four Forces

For change to happen: **PUSH + PULL > ALLEGIANCE + ANXIETY**

- **Push**: What's driving them away from current state?
- **Pull**: What's attractive about new solution?
- **Allegiance**: Comfort with current state
- **Anxiety**: Fear of change/failure

### Buyer Triggers

Even with strong triggers, **trust still matters**:
- Strong trigger + Low trust = Urgent nurture (not sales push)
- Strong trigger + High trust = Fast-track to demo
- Weak trigger + High trust = Long-term relationship
- Weak trigger + Low trust = Deprioritize

## Application

### In Content
- Lead with value, not pitch
- Match content depth to trust level
- Progress through funnel naturally

### In Outreach
- Email 1: Pure value, no ask
- Build credibility through insights
- Earn the right to ask for time

### In ABM
- Warmup phase builds trust
- Multi-touch across channels
- Sales engagement after trust established

### In Sales
- Discovery before pitching
- Co-create, don't present
- Champion enablement over closing

## Common Violations

1. **Demo request on cold outreach** - Trust 0, asking for Level 4
2. **Generic personalization** - Reduces perceived relevance
3. **Feature dumping** - Self-focus before trust earned
4. **Aggressive follow-up** - Pushes people away
5. **Skipping warmup** - Asking before earning

## Success Metrics

- Reply rate to outreach
- Engagement progression
- Conversion at each trust level
- Customer satisfaction post-sale
- Referral rate
