# Fletch PMM Framework

**Source**: Anthony Pierri & Robert Kaminski - FletchPMM.com

## Core Philosophy

Vague positioning leads to incomprehensible websites, low engagement, ineffective ads, and unproductive sales meetings.

**Solution**: Clear positioning creates converting websites, demand-generating content, and sales narratives that close.

## The Product Marketing Canvas

Four core questions (read left to right):

1. **Who it's for** (Target Customers)
2. **What it does** (Capabilities)
3. **How it works** (Features)
4. **Why that matters** (Benefits)

## Key Definitions

### Capability
"New abilities your product unlocks"

- What customers can NOW do that they couldn't before
- Outcome-focused, not feature-focused
- Action-oriented

**Example:**
- Feature: "Real-time GPS tracking"
- Capability: "See exact location of every shipment in real-time"

### Feature
"Technical aspects that power capabilities"

### Benefit
"The state change capabilities drive"

**Example:**
- Capability: "Automate freight invoice reconciliation"
- Benefit: "Reduce billing errors by 95%, save 20 hours/week"

## Capability-Market-Fit Framework

### The Core Problem
Combining capabilities no one cares about doesn't make a powerful product.

### The Process

1. **List all product capabilities**
2. **Evaluate market interest for EACH**
   - Is there a specific market that cares?
   - How much do they care?
   - Are they actively solving this today?
3. **Find ONE compelling capability** that resonates with specific market
4. **Resist sunk-cost fallacy** - focus on what market wants

**Avoid:**
- Trying to be Swiss Army knife
- Feature bloat to appeal to everyone
- "We do X, Y, Z, and also W"

**Pursue:**
- Laser focus on one capability
- Deep resonance with specific market
- Clear, simple value proposition

## Homepage Hero Formula

**Headline**: [Capability] for [Target Customer]
**Subheadline**: [How you do it uniquely]
**CTA**: [Specific action]
**Social Proof**: [Recognizable logos]

## Common Messaging Mistakes

### 1. Leading with Benefits Before Capabilities
- "Increase operational efficiency" tells nothing
- "Automate freight invoice reconciliation → Save 20 hours/week" is clear

### 2. Generic Target Customer
- "For logistics companies" is too broad
- "For mid-market manufacturers shipping 50+ loads/day" is specific

### 3. Feature Dumping
- Listing 20 features doesn't help
- Focus on ONE core capability, support with features

### 4. Solution Looking for Problem
- Validate market need first

### 5. Positioning by Features, Not Outcomes
- Customers buy outcomes, not features

## Messaging Hierarchy

### Level 1: Strategic Messaging
**Purpose**: High-level company positioning
**Audience**: Board, investors, all company messaging
**Components**:
- Company mission/vision
- Core value proposition
- Primary differentiation
- Key market positioning

### Level 2: Product Messaging
**Purpose**: Specific product positioning
**Audience**: Product marketing, sales, web content
**Components**:
- Product capabilities
- Feature-benefit mapping
- Use case scenarios
- Competitive positioning

### Level 3: Campaign Messaging
**Purpose**: Specific campaign or channel
**Audience**: Ads, social posts, email campaigns
**Components**:
- Campaign-specific hooks
- Channel-optimized copy
- Call-to-action messaging
- Offer positioning

**Key Insight**: Each level should cascade from the one above, ensuring consistency across all touchpoints.

## Minimum Viable Positioning

The bare minimum to:
- Test market resonance
- Get initial customers
- Validate product-market fit

**Components:**
1. Target Customer (specific!)
2. Core Capability (one thing)
3. Key Differentiation (why you, not alternatives)
4. Primary Outcome (measurable benefit)

## The Features → Capabilities → Benefits Chain

**Example:**
- Feature: "6-8 week implementation"
- Capability: "Go live in one quarter, not six months"
- Benefit: "Hit FY targets, don't wait until next year"
