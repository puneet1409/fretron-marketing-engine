# Discovering Positioning Angles

## Core Insight

**Start with what they're actually using today (not phantom competitors), then find the ONE capability that matters most to a specific market.**

Don't try to be everything. Find capability-market-fit.

## The Positioning Process

### Step 1: Identify Real Alternatives

What would they do if you didn't exist?
- Excel + manual processes (most common)
- Legacy systems painful to change
- Partial point solutions
- Do nothing / status quo

**Not**: The enterprise competitor you wish you competed with.

### Step 2: Isolate Unique Attributes

Compare to each alternative. What can you do that they can't?

| vs Alternative | Unique Attribute |
|----------------|------------------|
| vs Excel | Visibility, automation, integration |
| vs Legacy | Speed, cost, flexibility |
| vs Point Solutions | Unified view, depth |
| vs Status Quo | Measurable outcomes |

### Step 3: Apply "So What?" Test

Keep asking until you reach something they care about:

```
Attribute: Fast implementation
→ So what?
Benefit: Live in weeks, not months
→ So what?
Impact: Hit this quarter's targets
```

### Step 4: Find Capability-Market-Fit

Which ONE capability resonates MOST with which specific segment?

Test candidates:
- "See everything in real-time" (visibility)
- "Find 10-15% cost savings" (cost)
- "Go live in weeks" (speed)
- "Prove ROI before committing" (de-risk)

### Step 5: Define Best-Fit Customer

Be radically specific:

> "Mid-market [industry] doing [volume] who've outgrown [current approach] but can't stomach [enterprise alternative]"

Specify: Industry, size, pain, trigger, decision makers.

### Step 6: Frame Market Category

Choose the category that makes your value obvious:

| Category | Tradeoff |
|----------|----------|
| Established category | Known, but compared to giants |
| Niche subcategory | Specific, but may seem limited |
| New category | Differentiated, but requires education |

## Positioning Statement Template

"For [target customer] who [pain point], [Product] is the [category] that [key differentiator]. Unlike [alternatives], we [unique value]."

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Passes "So what?" at every level
- [ ] Target customer recognizes themselves
- [ ] Sales can articulate in 30 seconds
- [ ] Proof exists or can be built
- [ ] Differentiates from actual alternatives

## Common Mistakes

1. **Leading with features** - Start with outcomes
2. **Boiling the ocean** - Pick ONE angle, nail it
3. **Phantom competitors** - Compare to actual alternatives
4. **Generic benefits** - "Save time and money" says nothing
5. **Too complex too early** - Progressive disclosure
