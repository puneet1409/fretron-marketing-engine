# Fretron Positioning Context

Current GTM strategy and positioning assets for Move-as-One Command Center.

## Current External Wedge

**Dispatch Value Audit** - The lead offer for mid-market India:

> "Find 8-15% freight cost savings and 3-5 point OTIF uplift on your top lanes - without ripping out your TMS."

Move-as-One is the ENGINE behind this audit, not the headline.

## Productised Audit Offer

- **Inputs**: 30-45 min remote session (Light Diagnostic) + optional 3-6 months data for 5-10 lanes
- **Outputs**:
  - 1-2 page Value Snapshot
  - Current levels on Cost, Service, Risk, Digital
  - 3-5 levers you're ready to pull
  - Opportunity band (₹/year + OTIF points)
  - Pilot proposal sketch
- **SLA**: 7-10 working days

## Exposure Rules (What to Reveal When)

### Stage 0 - Outreach
**Allowed:**
- Outcomes: cost, OTIF, detention, compliance
- Plain-English levers: "truck fill", "better routing", "disciplined spot buying"
- "Dispatch Value Audit" brand

**Forbidden:**
- Lever lists, ladder diagrams, maturity jargon, "digital twin"

### Stage 1 - Discover (First Session)
**Allowed:**
- Simple Value Map (3-4 pillars → 2-3 KPIs → 2-3 levers each)
- "Levers" concept ("knobs you can turn")
- "Levels" language: "early/medium/advanced on cost/service"
- Light ladder view: "Basic → Improving → Leading"

**Forbidden:**
- Lever IDs, full library, hardcore ladder detail

### Stage 2 - Design
**Allowed:**
- Ladder term with simple description
- Readiness concept (Data/SOP/Tech bars)
- Specific lever names for the 2-3 under consideration

**Hidden:**
- Full 80+ lever taxonomy
- Non-relevant levers

### Stage 3-4 - Deploy & Drive
**Allowed:**
- Ladder progress charts
- More levers for future phases
- Impact vs modeled impact

## Sales Script Constraints

**Don't say:**
- "We have 80+ levers and 11 lever families"
- "We'll do a digital twin"

**Do say:**
- "We have a structured playbook; for you, these 2-3 levers matter first"
- "We'll simulate what would have happened on your lanes if we consolidated loads"

## Required Proof Stories

Need 2-3 hard case studies:

### 1. Cost Ladder L1→L2 (Steel/Cement)
- Levers: Load Optimiser + Digital Spot Bidding
- Scope: 5-10 lanes
- Outcome: PKMMT -8-12%, LTL% down

### 2. Service Ladder L1→L2 (FMCG)
- Levers: Vehicle Placement Automation + Tracking + E-POD
- Outcome: OTIF +3-6 pts, detention down

### 3. Risk/Compliance L1→L2
- Levers: EWB automation, doc checks, detention visibility
- Outcome: Penalties down, fewer shipment holds

## Competitive Alternatives (Real, Not Phantom)

For mid-market India, customers are ACTUALLY using:
- Excel + WhatsApp + phone calls
- Legacy TMS they're afraid to change
- Point solutions (tracking-only, e-POD only)
- Manual broker relationships
- "Do nothing" / spreadsheet chaos

**Not phantom competitors like Oracle TMS or SAP TM** (most mid-market can't afford or implement these).

## Key Differentiators

1. **Speed**: 6-8 week implementation vs 6-12 months
2. **Pricing**: Transaction-based, no CAPEX
3. **India-specific**: GST/E-way bill, regional patterns
4. **Value-first approach**: Prove ROI on lanes before full rollout
5. **Right-sized**: Not overbuilt (SAP) or underbuilt (point solutions)

## Target Segment

Mid-market Indian manufacturers:
- 50-200 loads/day
- Outgrown Excel
- Can't stomach 12-month SAP implementation
- Verticals: Steel, Cement, FMCG, Auto parts, Chemicals
