# April Dunford's 5-Component Positioning Framework

**Source**: "Obviously Awesome" by April Dunford

## Core Definition

> "Positioning defines how your product is a leader at delivering something that a well-defined set of customers cares a lot about."

## The 5 Components (In Order)

### 1. Competitive Alternatives
What customers would use if your solution didn't exist.

**Key Questions:**
- What are customers doing TODAY?
- What would they do if we disappeared?
- Include "do nothing" as valid alternative

**Avoid phantom competitors** - focus on ACTUAL behavior, not theoretical competitors.

### 2. Unique Attributes
What you have that alternatives do not.

**Types:**
- Functional (unique features)
- Technical (performance, integration)
- Delivery (implementation speed, support)
- Business Model (pricing structure)

### 3. Value (The "So What?" Test)
Concrete benefits from your unique attributes.

**Process:**
1. Start with attribute
2. Ask "So what?" → first benefit
3. Keep asking until business impact
4. Express in customer language

**Value Categories:**
- Cost reduction
- Revenue increase
- Risk mitigation
- Time savings
- Competitive advantage

### 4. Target Customer Segments
Who cares MOST about your unique value.

**Be specific:**
- Industry/vertical
- Company size
- Use case
- Technical maturity
- Buying behavior

### 5. Market Category
Context that makes your value obvious.

**Options:**
1. **Existing category** - understood, budget exists, but established competitors
2. **Adjacent category** - leverage understanding with slight repositioning
3. **New category** - no competition but education burden

## Sales Pitch Structure

1. "You know how [target customers] struggle with [problem] using [alternatives]?"
2. "We're different because [unique attributes]"
3. "Which means you can [specific outcomes]"
4. "In fact, [success story]"

## Common Mistakes

1. **Positioning by committee** - dilutes differentiation
2. **Boil the ocean** - trying to be everything
3. **Feature-focused** - lead with value, not features
4. **Aspirational** - position for who you ARE, not who you want to be
5. **Ignoring alternatives** - always anchor to what customers actually compare you to
