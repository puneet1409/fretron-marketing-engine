# Positioning Workshop Guide (April Dunford)

A structured approach to developing or refining positioning.

## Workshop Overview

**Purpose**: Align team on positioning through structured discovery

**Participants**: Product, Marketing, Sales, Customer Success, Founders

**Duration**: Half-day (4-5 hours)

**Output**: Clear positioning statement and messaging framework

## Workshop Agenda

### 1. Review Current Positioning (30 min)
- What do we say today?
- What's working? What's not?
- Customer feedback on messaging
- Sales feedback on resonance

### 2. Identify Competitive Alternatives (45 min)
- What are customers ACTUALLY doing today?
- What would they do if we didn't exist?
- Include "do nothing" as valid alternative
- Focus on real behavior, not phantom competitors

**Key Question**: "What is the customer comparing us to?"

### 3. Determine Unique Attributes (45 min)
- What can Fretron do that alternatives cannot?
- Features, capabilities, delivery, business model
- Be specific and honest
- Avoid "table stakes" features

**Key Question**: "What makes us genuinely different?"

### 4. Map to Customer Value (60 min)
For each unique attribute, ask "So what?" repeatedly:

| Attribute | So What? | So What? | Business Impact |
|-----------|----------|----------|-----------------|
| 6-8 week implementation | Faster go-live | Hit Q1 targets | Revenue protection |
| Transaction pricing | No CAPEX needed | Easier approval | Faster procurement |
| Indian-market design | GST/E-way built in | Less integration | Lower TCO |

### 5. Define Target Customers (45 min)
- Who cares MOST about this value?
- Be radically specific
- Characteristics: industry, size, current pain, trigger

**Template**:
"[Industry] companies with [size/volume] who are [current state] and need to [goal] because of [trigger]"

**Example**:
"Mid-market Indian manufacturers shipping 50-200 loads/day who've outgrown Excel but can't stomach a 12-month SAP implementation"

### 6. Select Market Category (45 min)
Choose category that makes value obvious:

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| Existing category | Known, budget exists | Compared to leaders |
| Adjacent category | Leverage understanding | May need explanation |
| New category | No competition | Heavy education burden |

**For Fretron**: Lead with "Dispatch Value Audit" (wedge) → reveal full TMS gradually

### 7. Craft Positioning Statement (30 min)

**Template**:
"For [target customer] who [pain point], Fretron is the [category] that [key differentiator]. Unlike [alternatives], we [unique value]."

**Example**:
"For mid-market manufacturers struggling with Excel-based dispatch, Fretron is the value-first TMS that proves ROI on your top lanes before full commitment. Unlike enterprise TMS vendors, we go live in weeks, not months, with pay-per-transaction pricing."

### 8. Plan Testing and Rollout (30 min)
- How will we test this messaging?
- What assets need updating?
- Timeline for rollout
- Success metrics

## Key Principles

### Interdependence of Components
- All 5 components work together
- Changing one affects the others
- Start with competitive alternatives (anchors the exercise)
- Iterate until coherent story emerges

### Avoid Phantom Competitors
**Phantom Competitor**: Theoretical competitor you'd like to compete against but customers don't actually consider.

**Example:**
- Wrong: "We're like Salesforce but for logistics"
- Right: "We replace Excel and email for shipment tracking"

### Positioning Sets Expectations
- Category choice determines what customers expect
- Differentiation must be relevant within that category
- Value must align with category norms and pricing

## Measuring Positioning Effectiveness

### Leading Indicators
- Sales team can articulate positioning clearly
- Prospects immediately "get it"
- Reduced time explaining what we do
- Qualified leads increasing

### Lagging Indicators
- Win rate improvement
- Higher deal values
- Better customer fit
- Reduced churn

## When to Reposition

Consider repositioning when:
- Entering new market segments
- Product capabilities have significantly evolved
- Competitive landscape has shifted
- Current positioning isn't resonating
- Sales cycles too long or win rates too low

## Discovery Questions Aligned to Positioning

**Understanding Alternatives:**
- "What are you using today for [category]?"
- "What's not working about [alternative]?"
- "What would you do if we didn't exist?"

**Validating Value:**
- "How important is [unique value] to your business?"
- "What would it mean if you could [outcome]?"
- "What have you tried before to achieve this?"

**Testing Category:**
- "How would you describe what we do to a colleague?"
- "What budget would this come from?"
- "Who else would you need to involve in this decision?"

## Handling Objections with Positioning

| Objection | Positioning Response |
|-----------|---------------------|
| "You're different from [competitor]" | Reframe market category |
| "We already have [alternative]" | Highlight unique value gap |
| "That's expensive" | Reinforce unique value and ROI |
| "We're not ready" | Adjust to lower-commitment entry point |

## Common Positioning Mistakes (April Dunford)

### 1. Positioning by Committee
**Problem**: Trying to please everyone dilutes differentiation
**Solution**: Make decisions based on target customer feedback, not internal opinions

### 2. "Boil the Ocean" Positioning
**Problem**: Trying to be everything to everyone
**Solution**: Focus on one target segment and nail it, then expand

### 3. Feature-Focused Positioning
**Problem**: Leading with features instead of value
**Solution**: Always translate features to customer outcomes using "So what?" test

### 4. Aspirational Positioning
**Problem**: Positioning for who you want to be, not who you are
**Solution**: Be honest about current capabilities and differentiation

### 5. Ignoring Competitive Alternatives
**Problem**: Positioning in a vacuum without considering what customers actually compare you to
**Solution**: Start with competitive alternatives to anchor positioning

## Repositioning Process

### When to Reposition
- Entering new market segments
- Product capabilities have significantly evolved
- Competitive landscape has shifted
- Current positioning isn't resonating
- Sales cycles too long or win rates too low

### How to Reposition
1. Go through 5-component framework again
2. Test new positioning with subset of customers
3. Measure impact on key metrics (win rate, sales cycle, deal size)
4. If successful, roll out across organization
5. Update all marketing and sales materials

### Repositioning Risks
- Confusing existing customers
- Alienating current market
- Sales team resistance
- Resource investment to update materials

**Mitigation**: Test carefully, communicate clearly, involve sales early
