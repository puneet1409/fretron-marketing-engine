# Tracking Competitor Moves

## Core Insight

**Know your real competitors (what they actually use today) and compete on differentiation, not features.**

Track what matters to buying decisions, not everything competitors do.

## Competitive Analysis Framework

### What to Track

| Element | Where to Find | Frequency |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| Positioning/messaging | Homepage, product pages | Monthly |
| New features | Blog, release notes | Weekly |
| Pricing | Pricing page, reviews | Quarterly |
| Customer wins | Case studies, LinkedIn | Monthly |
| Job postings | Careers page | Monthly (signals priorities) |

### Battlecard Template

```
## vs [Competitor]

**Quick Facts**: Founded, funding, customers, focus

**When We Win**: [2-3 scenarios]
**When We Lose**: [1-2 scenarios]

**Their Strengths**: [Acknowledge honestly]
**Their Weaknesses**: [Emphasize tactfully]

**Landmines**: Questions that expose their gaps
**Proof Points**: Our evidence against them
```

## Competitive Response Playbook

### When They Launch Feature

1. Does it matter to our ICP?
2. Is it real or vaporware?
3. Do we have it? Emphasize ours.
4. Don't have it? Minimize or roadmap.
5. Update battlecard, notify sales.

### When They Drop Price

1. Verify (real or promotional?)
2. What's the catch?
3. Emphasize value/TCO, not price match.

### When They Win Our Deal

1. Debrief: Why?
2. Document in win/loss
3. Update battlecard if pattern
4. Stay in touch (for when they regret)

## Win/Loss Analysis

After every competitive deal:
- Decision factors (what mattered?)
- What worked / didn't work
- Key learnings
- Battlecard update needed?

### Quarterly Review

- Win rate vs each competitor
- Common winning scenarios
- Common losing scenarios
- Recommended adjustments

## B2B Tech Competitive Context

**Real competitors often aren't other vendors:**
- Excel + manual processes
- "Do nothing" / status quo
- Internal IT build

**Position against actual alternatives**, not aspirational competitors.
