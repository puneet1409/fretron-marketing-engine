# Running ABM Events

**Depends on**: `warming-up-accounts`, `trust-building-principles`

## Core Insight

**Events compress trust-building time by creating shared experiences. Small format builds deep relationships with few accounts. Large format builds awareness across many.**

## Event Types Matrix

| Format | Accounts | Trust Impact | Investment | Best For |
|--------|----------|--------------|------------|----------|
| **1-to-1 Briefing** | 1 | Very High | Low | Tier 1 deal acceleration |
| **Executive Dinner** | 5-10 | High | Medium | Tier 1 relationship building |
| **Roundtable** | 10-20 | High | Medium | Tier 1-2 thought leadership |
| **Webinar** | 50-200 | Medium | Low | Tier 2-3 awareness |
| **Conference** | 200+ | Low-Medium | High | Broad awareness |
| **Field Event** | 20-50 | Medium-High | Medium | Regional concentration |

## Small Format Events (1-to-Few)

### Executive Dinner / Roundtable

**Purpose**: Deep relationship building with 5-15 Tier 1 accounts

**Planning (4-6 weeks before)**:
1. Define theme relevant to target accounts
2. Select venue (quality signals importance)
3. Curate guest list (peer-to-peer value)
4. Identify host/facilitator (executive or industry expert)
5. Plan agenda (conversation, not presentation)

**Invitation Approach**:
```
"Hi [Name], I'm hosting an intimate dinner for [X] leaders
in [industry] to discuss [theme]. Given your experience
with [their situation], I thought you'd add valuable
perspective to the conversation.

It's peer-to-peer - no pitches, just candid discussion
over dinner at [venue] on [date].

Would you be interested in joining?"
```

**Execution**:
- Introductions that highlight each guest's expertise
- Facilitated discussion, not presentation
- Equal airtime for all participants
- No product pitching during event
- Capture insights (with permission)

**Post-Event Activation**:
- Day 1: Thank you + summary of key insights
- Day 3: Personalized follow-up based on their contributions
- Day 7: 1-to-1 meeting offer if appropriate
- Day 14: Share content derived from discussion

### 1-to-1 Executive Briefing

**Purpose**: Deep dive with single Tier 1 account

**Format Options**:
- Strategy session at your office
- Lunch/coffee meeting
- Virtual briefing (video)
- Site visit to your facility

**Content Framework**:
1. Their situation: Demonstrate understanding
2. Industry context: Share relevant insights
3. Peer examples: What similar companies are doing
4. Potential approach: Tailored recommendations
5. Discussion: Q&A and mutual exploration

**Key Principle**: 80% listening, 20% presenting

---

## Large Format Events (1-to-Many)

### Webinar

**Purpose**: Reach Tier 2-3 accounts at scale

**Planning (3-4 weeks before)**:
1. Define topic tied to ICP pain points
2. Choose format (solo, panel, interview)
3. Plan promotion across channels
4. Create registration page
5. Prepare slides and script
6. Set up recording

**Promotion Sequence**:
| Day | Channel | Action |
|-----|---------|--------|
| -21 | Email | Announcement to database |
| -14 | LinkedIn | Organic post + event page |
| -14 | Ads | Retargeting to website visitors |
| -7 | Email | Reminder + early insights |
| -3 | LinkedIn | "Seats filling up" post |
| -1 | Email | Final reminder |
| 0 | All | "Starting now" |

**Execution Best Practices**:
- Start on time
- Opening hook within 60 seconds
- Engage every 5-7 minutes (poll, question, story)
- Reserve 15-20% for Q&A
- Clear next step CTA at end

**Post-Webinar Activation**:
- Immediate: Thank you + recording link
- Day 1: Segment by engagement level
- Day 3: Attendees - personalized follow-up
- Day 3: No-shows - recording + key takeaways
- Day 7: Hot prospects - sales outreach

### Content Hub Post-Event

Create a hub with:
- Recording (gated or ungated)
- Slides/deck
- Key insights summary
- Related resources
- Next step CTA (demo, consultation, etc.)

Track engagement to identify hot prospects.

## Virtual Summit (Large-Scale 1-to-Many)

**Build this AFTER you have relationships from other playbooks (podcast, industry reports). Not a first-step play.**

### Why Virtual Summits Work

- Multiple speakers creates higher perception of value
- Can generate 1,000-5,000 registrations with 800+ target accounts
- Massive brand awareness and credibility
- Content creation machine (repurpose into months of content)
- Include your own workshops for warmup and demand creation
- Activation workshops for highly engaged accounts

### Prerequisites (Don't Skip These)

1. Existing relationships from podcast or industry report series
2. Customer relationships for case study speakers
3. Industry influencer connections
4. Complementary partner network
5. Internal capacity to manage 50+ speaker logistics

### Virtual Summit Playbook

**Step 1: Plan and Position (8-12 weeks before)**
- Research existing events in your industry
- Define unique positioning (not "just another summit")
- Decide scale: panel, mini-summit, or multi-day event
- Consider "growth stacking": start smaller, build up

**Step 2: Recruit Speakers and Partners**
Categories to invite:
- Best customers (strengthen relationship, get case studies)
- Industry influencers/thought leaders (from your podcast connections)
- Complementary partners (audience exchange)
- Target buyers (as speakers or panelists)

Onboarding each speaker:
- Pre-defined process: timeline, promotion expectations, content requirements
- Let them choose topics/days they prefer
- Make commitment to promotion clear upfront

**Step 3: Create Agenda and Landing Page**
- Include YOUR workshops for warmup and demand creation
- Partner with industry associations and media
- Create promotional assets for each speaker (graphics, copy)

**Step 4: Promotion Sequence**
- Leverage speaker networks (make it easy with prepared content)
- Email sequences to registrants pre-event (warm them up)
- Remind speakers of their promotion commitments

**Step 5: Execute with State Changes**
Every 3-5 minutes, change something:
- Switch speakers
- Ask for comments in chat
- Run polls
- Live exercises or coaching
- Audience Q&A with camera on

**Step 6: Run Activation Workshop**
- After or during summit
- For highly engaged accounts
- Product-related but value-focused
- Case study presentation or live demo
- Topic-specific deep dive

**Step 7: Post-Event Activation**
Content hub with:
- Recordings and slides
- Case studies and proof points
- Comparison reports
- Benefits by buying committee role
- Clear CTAs throughout

Track engagement:
- Which accounts viewed which documents
- Time spent on specific sections
- Use for personalized follow-up

**Step 8: Personalized Follow-Up**
```
"Hi [Name], what did you think of the case study
we shared? A lot of people asked me about [topic
they spent time on in content hub].

If this is interesting to you, I'd be happy to
hop on a call and share examples from [similar
company] where we can open up and show the
exact [criteria/process] we used.

Would that be valuable?"
```

### Growth Stacking Strategy

Don't start with a 50-speaker summit. Build up:

1. **Year 1 Q1-Q2**: Social engagement, "permissionless co-marketing"
2. **Year 1 Q3-Q4**: Podcast series, industry report interviews
3. **Year 2 Q1**: Panel discussion (3-4 speakers)
4. **Year 2 Q2**: Mini-summit (10-15 speakers)
5. **Year 2 Q3+**: Multi-day summit (30-50+ speakers)

## Cluster Event (1-to-Few with Activation)

**Focus on a specific cluster of accounts with shared challenges. Much higher conversion than broad events.**

### When to Use Cluster Events

- Accounts share a common trigger (M&A, expansion, compliance deadline)
- Accounts in same industry vertical with same challenge
- Adjacent to trade show where targets are already attending
- Regional concentration of target accounts

### Cluster Event Playbook

**Step 1: Define Target Account Cluster**
Sources:
- Your database filtered by shared need/trigger
- Partnership with accelerator, association, or industry group
- Accounts attending specific trade show

Example: Companies between $5-10M that recently went through M&A need to onboard acquired employees onto new systems.

**Step 2: Survey Cluster to Identify Shared Challenges**
- Quick survey or discovery calls
- Identify top 2-3 shared challenges
- Validate JTBD across cluster
- Design workshop specifically for #1 challenge

**Step 3: Create Cluster-Specific Workshop**
- Address the specific shared challenge
- Include your expert (AE, CSM, consultant) who has solved this before
- Provide actionable takeaways, not just theory
- Plan activation: 1-on-1 debriefing offers

**Step 4: Offer 1-on-1 Debriefing as Activation**
```
"After the workshop, we're offering 1-on-1 debriefing
sessions with [Expert Name] who designed learning
programs for [Client] during their acquisition of [Company].

Would you like a 30-minute session to discuss how
this applies to your specific situation?"
```

**Step 5: Create Personalized Content Hub**
Include:
- Workshop recording and materials
- Case studies specific to their challenge
- Comparison information for evaluators
- Benefits for each buying committee role
- Clear CTA for demo/consultation

**Step 6: Track Engagement and Personalize Follow-Up**
```
"Hi [Name], I noticed you spent some time on the
section about [specific topic from content hub].
A lot of companies struggle with that.

Would you like me to share the exact messages
we used to promote the program internally at
[similar company] and get high adoption?"
```

### Cluster Event Formats

| Format | Setting | Size | Activation |
|--------|---------|------|------------|
| Virtual workshop | Remote | 20-50 | 1-on-1 video debriefs |
| Breakfast roundtable | Trade show adjacent | 10-20 | Coffee meetings same day |
| Dinner event | Industry conference | 8-15 | Follow-up calls next week |
| Field event | Regional office/venue | 15-30 | On-site consultations |

### Results Benchmark

With proper targeting and activation:
- Cluster of 12 accounts → 5 won deals possible
- Debriefing conversion: 40-60% of attendees
- Pipeline from cluster events: 30-50% of attendees

---

## Conference Participation

### Pre-Event (2-4 weeks before)

**Target Account Identification**:
- Get attendee list if available
- Research which target accounts will attend
- Prioritize: Who do we most want to meet?

**Pre-Event Outreach**:
```
"Hi [Name], I noticed [Company] is attending [Event].
I'll be there representing [Our Company] and would
love to connect. Would you have 15 minutes for a
coffee during the event?

We've been helping [industry] companies with [area]
and thought there might be some relevant insights
to share."
```

**Booth/Presence Strategy**:
- Design for engagement, not just collection
- Interactive demo or assessment
- Valuable giveaway (content, not tchotchkes)
- Staff with people who can have real conversations

### During Event

**Engagement Tactics**:
- Attend sessions where targets speak
- Approach during breaks with specific questions
- Host impromptu meetups (coffee, drinks)
- Take notes on insights to share

**Booth Engagement**:
- Qualify quickly (ICP fit?)
- Demo only if they want it
- Capture context (what brought them, what's their situation)
- Set specific next step

### Post-Event (Within 1 week)

**Immediate Follow-Up Segmentation**:

| Lead Type | Follow-Up |
|-----------|-----------|
| Hot (demo request) | Same-day email + calendar link |
| Warm (good conversation) | Day 1-2 personalized email |
| Cool (badge scan only) | Day 3-5 nurture sequence |
| Connected (no booth visit) | Day 3-5 "Nice meeting you" |

**Follow-Up Email Template**:
```
Subject: Great meeting you at [Event]

Hi [Name],

It was great connecting at [Event] - I enjoyed our
conversation about [specific topic you discussed].

As promised, [here's the resource/info/intro I mentioned].

Based on what you shared about [their situation],
I think there might be some interesting parallels
with what we've seen at [similar company].
