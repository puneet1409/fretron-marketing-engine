# Running ABM Events

**Depends on**: `warming-up-accounts`, `trust-building-principles`

## Core Insight

**Events compress trust-building time through shared experiences. Match event format to account tier and relationship depth.**

## Event Format Selection

| Format | Accounts | Trust Impact | Best For |
|--------|----------|--------------|----------|
| **1-to-1 Briefing** | 1 | Very High | Tier 1 deal acceleration |
| **Executive Dinner** | 5-10 | High | Tier 1 relationship building |
| **Roundtable** | 10-20 | High | Tier 1-2 thought leadership |
| **Cluster Event** | 20-50 | Medium-High | Accounts with shared challenge |
| **Webinar** | 50-200 | Medium | Tier 2-3 awareness |
| **Virtual Summit** | 200-5000 | Low-Medium | Broad awareness, content creation |

---

## Small Format Events (1-to-Few)

**Purpose**: Deep relationship building with Tier 1 accounts.

**Key principles**:
- Peer-to-peer value (curate guest list carefully)
- Facilitated discussion, not presentation
- No product pitching during event
- 80% listening, 20% sharing

**Post-event activation**: Thank you → Personalized follow-up → 1-to-1 offer if appropriate.

---

## Cluster Events

**When to use**: Accounts share a common trigger (M&A, expansion, compliance) or challenge.

**Core elements**:
- Survey cluster to identify shared challenges
- Design workshop for #1 shared challenge
- Offer 1-on-1 debriefing as activation
- Create personalized content hub for follow-up

**Results benchmark**: 12 accounts → 5 won deals possible with proper activation.

---

## Large Format Events

### Webinar

**State change method**: Change something every 3-5 minutes (speaker switch, poll, question, story).

**Post-event**: Segment by engagement → Personalized follow-up for attendees → Recording + key takeaways for no-shows.

### Virtual Summit

**Prerequisites** (don't skip): Existing relationships from podcast/content, customer speakers, partner network.

**Growth stacking strategy**:
1. Social engagement, permissionless co-marketing
2. Podcast series, industry report interviews
3. Panel discussion (3-4 speakers)
4. Mini-summit (10-15 speakers)
5. Multi-day summit (30-50+ speakers)

**Key insight**: Include YOUR workshops for warmup and demand creation. Run activation workshop for highly engaged accounts.

---

## Conference Participation

**Pre-event**: Get attendee list, identify targets, pre-book meetings.

**During**: Attend sessions where targets speak, approach with specific questions.

**Post-event segmentation**:

| Lead Type | Follow-Up Timing |
|-----------|------------------|
| Hot (demo request) | Same day |
| Warm (good conversation) | Day 1-2 |
| Cool (badge scan only) | Day 3-5, nurture |

---

## Event Selection Criteria

Questions to evaluate any event:

1. **Target account concentration**: How many ICP accounts will attend?
2. **Content opportunity**: Can we create/repurpose content?
3. **Relationship depth**: Does format match our relationship stage?
4. **Cost per target contact**: Is the investment justified?

---

## Integration

- Before event → Warm up accounts with `warming-up-accounts`
- For content repurposing → Use `atomizing-content`
- For follow-up → Use `writing-b2b-emails`
- For cluster approach → Use `cluster-abm`
