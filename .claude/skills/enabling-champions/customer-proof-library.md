has time to actually improve operations instead of just
tracking shipments."

me wrong—we were live in 6 weeks and seeing results in 90 days."
— Head of SCM, [Cement Company], ₹500 Cr revenue

"The visibility is game-changing. I can answer any question
about any shipment in 30 seconds. Before, that took 3 hours."

CFO QUOTES:

detention alone than the entire system costs."

"Finally, I have visibility into true freight costs. No more
invoice surprises. No more 45-day reconciliation."
— VP Finance, [Cement Company], ₹700 Cr revenue

for what we use, and we're already cash-positive on it."
— CFO, [FMCG Company], ₹400 Cr revenue

OPERATIONS QUOTES:
