## Demo Structure (45 Minutes)

### Opening (5 Minutes)

**Script**:
```
"Thanks for taking the time today. Before I show you
anything, let me make sure I understand what you're
hoping to solve.

Based on our earlier conversation, it sounds like
[recap their top 2-3 pain points]. Is that still
accurate? Anything changed or I should add?

[Listen and confirm]

Great. What I'll do is focus on those specific areas.
I'll show you how Fretron handles [pain point 1],
then [pain point 2], and we'll save time for questions.

Sound good?"
```

### Demo Flow (30 Minutes)

**Section 1: The Day-to-Day (10 min)**

```
"Let me start with what your dispatch team would see
every morning.

[Show dashboard]

This is your command center. Every shipment across all
plants, all carriers, one view. No need to log into
multiple systems or call anyone.

[Point to specific elements]

See this number? That's your exception count. Instead
of tracking 500 shipments, your team focuses on the
15 that need attention.

[Show alert]

When something goes wrong—delay, deviation, ETA miss—
the system catches it and alerts the right person.
Before customers call.

Quick question: How does your team currently find out
about delays?

[Listen, connect to their pain]

Right, so instead of [their current painful process],
you'd see this..."
```

**Section 2: The Pain Point Solution (10 min)**

```
[Customize to their #1 pain point]

FOR TRACKING PAIN:
"You mentioned tracking calls are killing your team.
Let me show you why they disappear.

[Show tracking interface]

Real-time location, updated every 15 minutes. Your
team can see status without making a single call.

But here's the real win—your customers can too.

[Show customer portal]

You give customers access to track their own shipments.
70% of tracking calls go away overnight."

FOR COST PAIN:
"You mentioned freight costs are a concern. Let me
show you where the savings come from.

[Show rate management]

This is your contracted rate vs. what you actually
paid. See this gap? That's rate leakage—you're paying
more than you negotiated.

[Show detention view]

And this? Detention charges by carrier, by route.
Most companies don't even track this. We had a
customer find ₹45 lakh in detention they didn't
know they were paying."

FOR RECONCILIATION PAIN:
"You mentioned invoice reconciliation takes 45 days.
Let me show you how that becomes 7 days.

[Show reconciliation interface]

Every shipment automatically matched to invoice.
Discrepancies flagged instantly. No more hunting
through spreadsheets."
```

**Section 3: Implementation & Getting Started (5 min)**

```
"I know a common concern is 'this looks great but
what does implementation really look like?'

[Show implementation timeline]

6-8 weeks from kickoff to go-live. Here's what that
looks like:

Weeks 1-2: We configure to your setup—routes, carriers,
plants. Your team provides data, we do the work.

Weeks 3-4: Training and parallel run. We run alongside
your current process.

Weeks 5-6: Go-live on pilot lanes. You prove the value
before full rollout.

We've done this 100+ times. It's not an experiment."
```

**Section 4: Proof & Results (5 min)**

```
"Let me show you what companies like yours have achieved.

[Show relevant case study]

[Company Name], similar size to you, [Industry].
Their situation: [similar pain points].

Results after 90 days:
- [Metric 1]
- [Metric 2]
- [Metric 3]

Happy to connect you with their logistics head if
you'd like to hear it directly."
```

### Q&A and Close (10 Minutes)

```
"That's the core of what Fretron does. What questions
do you have?

[Handle questions]

Based on what you've seen, where do you see the
biggest value for [Company Name]?

[Listen]

What would you need to see or know to move forward
with a deeper evaluation?

[Listen, address]

Here's what I'd suggest as next steps:
1. [Appropriate next action based on conversation]
2. [Secondary action if applicable]

Does that make sense for where you are in the process?"
```

# OBJECTION HANDLING PLAYBOOK

## Framework: LAER

**L**isten - Let them fully express the concern
**A**cknowledge - Show you understand
**E**xplore - Ask questions to understand root cause
**R**espond - Address the real concern

---

## Common Objections & Responses

### OBJECTION 1: "We've tried systems before—they didn't work"

**What They're Really Saying**:
- Fear of wasted investment
- Past implementation failure trauma
- Skepticism about vendor promises
- Concern about team adoption

**Response Script**:
```
"That's a fair concern—and honestly, I hear it a lot.
Can I ask what happened with the previous system?

[Listen]

That makes sense. Here's why this might be different:

[If implementation was too long]:
We go live in 6-8 weeks, not 12 months. You'll know
within 90 days if it's working. No multi-year
commitment before you see results.

[If adoption was the problem]:
We focus on the dispatch team first—the people who
actually use it daily. If they don't adopt it, we
haven't succeeded. That's why we include hands-on
training and a 90-day adoption focus.

[If it was too complex]:
We're purpose-built for mid-market manufacturing—
not a giant enterprise system you have to cut down
to size. Only the features you need.

The difference: You prove it works before you're
fully committed. Does that address the concern?"
```

---

### OBJECTION 2: "The timing isn't right / We have other priorities"

**What They're Really Saying**:
- Not convinced of urgency
- Budget allocated elsewhere
- Change fatigue
- Political dynamics

**Response Script**:
```
"I totally understand—there's always a lot competing
for attention. Let me ask: what would need to change
for this to become a priority?

[Listen for the real blocker]

That's helpful to know.

[If budget-related]:
What if we could start with a pilot that proves the
ROI before requiring full budget approval? That way
you have data for the business case.

[If change fatigue]:
Totally get it. The good news is implementation is
lightweight—6-8 weeks, 0.5 FTE from IT, minimal
disruption. We've designed it to not be another
big project.

[If timing]:
When would be the right time to revisit? I can set
a reminder and reach out then with any relevant
updates.

In the meantime, would it be useful if I sent
[relevant content] so you have it when timing is right?"
```

---

### OBJECTION 3: "It's too expensive / We don't have budget"

**What They're Really Saying**:
- Don't see enough value yet
- Need to justify internally
- Price anchor from competitor
- Budget genuinely constrained

**Response Script**:
```
"I appreciate you raising that. When you say expensive,
is it compared to what you expected, or compared to
another option you're looking at?

[Listen]

[If value not clear]:
That tells me I haven't done a good job showing the
ROI. Let me share what similar companies have seen:
[Company] saved ₹1.2 Cr in year one. Their investment
was paid back in 6 months. Let me build a similar
model for your situation—would that help?

[If compared to competitor]:
What are they proposing? [Listen] Often the sticker
price doesn't tell the full story—implementation
costs, time to value, ongoing fees. Happy to do a
total cost comparison.

[If budget constrained]:
Understood. Our transaction-based pricing might help—
no big upfront license fee, you pay as you use.
Would spreading the cost differently change the
equation?

What would make the investment feel justified to you?"
```

---

### OBJECTION 4: "We need to think about it / discuss internally"

**What They're Really Saying**:
- Not ready to commit
- Need to involve others
- Have unanswered concerns
- Polite way to pause

**Response Script**:
```
"Of course—this is a meaningful decision. To help
that conversation, let me ask:

What are the main things you'll be discussing?

[Listen for real concerns]

That's helpful. Would it be useful if I:
1. Sent a summary of what we covered to share?
2. Joined a call with whoever else needs to be
   involved?
3. Provided additional information on [specific area]?

Who else will be part of the discussion?

[Get names, understand dynamics]

How can I best support the internal conversation
without being pushy?"
```

---

### OBJECTION 5: "What about integration with our ERP?"

**What They're Really Saying**:
- Worried about complexity
- Past integration failures
- IT will ask this question
- Real technical requirement

**Response Script**:
```
"Great question—integration is important. What ERP
are you running?

[Listen]

[If SAP/Oracle]:
We have pre-built connectors for SAP and Oracle.
We've integrated with both many times. Typical
integration timeline is 2-4 weeks.

[If Tally/other]:
We integrate via API. We've worked with [specific
ERPs] before. The approach is [explain].

The key thing: integration happens in parallel with
implementation, not after. By week 4, you have data
flowing both ways.

Would it help to have a technical call where we
dive deeper into integration specifics?"
```

---

### OBJECTION 6: "Our situation is different / unique"

**What They're Really Saying**:
- Skeptical it applies to them
- Have specific requirements
- Want customization
- Testing if you understand their business

**Response Script**:
```
"Tell me more about what makes your situation unique?

[Listen carefully—this is valuable information]

That's interesting. [Reflect back what you heard]

[If it's actually common]:
We actually see this a lot in [industry]. [Company]
had a similar situation—[brief story]. How they
handled it was [solution].

[If it's genuinely unique]:
That is specific. Let me think about how we'd
approach that... [Think out loud or acknowledge
need to follow up]

What would you need to see to be confident this
works for your specific situation?"
```

---

### OBJECTION 7: "We're looking at [Competitor] too"

**What They're Really Saying**:
- Doing due diligence
- May prefer competitor
- Fishing for differentiation
- Creating leverage

**Response Script**:
```
"That makes sense—you should be comparing options.
What's drawing you to [Competitor]?

[Listen—understand what they value]

That's fair. Here's how I'd think about the comparison:

[Competitor] is great at [acknowledge their strength].
Where we're different:

1. [Key differentiator 1 relevant to their needs]
2. [Key differentiator 2 relevant to their needs]
3. [Key differentiator 3 relevant to their needs]

The question is: which matters more for your situation?

What criteria will you use to decide between options?

[Listen, then]

Happy to set up a call with a customer who evaluated
both and chose us—would that be useful?"
```

---

### OBJECTION 8: "Can you give us a discount?"

**What They're Really Saying**:
- Testing if there's room
- Budget pressure
- Want to feel they negotiated
- May be comparing to alternative

**Response Script**:
```
"I appreciate you asking directly. Let me understand
the context: is this about the overall budget, or
are you comparing to something else?

[Listen]

[If budget]:
We're already priced competitively for the value
delivered. That said, here are some things we can
explore:
- Phased rollout (lower initial investment)
- Longer commitment for better rate
- Different payment terms

What would make the investment work for you?

[If comparing]:
What are you comparing to? [Listen] Let me make sure
we're comparing apples to apples—sometimes the
headline price doesn't include everything.

[If just testing]:
We've already given you our best pricing for a
company your size. The value is in the results—
[Company] saw [X] return in [Y] months. If we
deliver that for you, the price is very reasonable."
```

## Competitive Positioning Scripts

### vs. SAP TM

```
"SAP TM is a solid product—if you're a very large
enterprise already running SAP everything.

Where we're different:
- Implementation: 6-8 weeks vs. 12-18 months
- IT resources: 0.5 FTE vs. 2-3 FTEs
- Pricing: Transaction-based vs. license + implementation
- Focus: Purpose-built for mid-market vs. scaled-down enterprise

The question is: do you need the full weight of SAP TM,
or do you need to solve the visibility and cost problem
quickly?

We integrate with SAP ERP just fine—you don't need
SAP TM for that."
```

### vs. Excel/Manual

```
"Excel works until it doesn't. Usually that point is
around 50-100 shipments a day.

The hidden costs you're paying with Excel:
- Tracking calls (time = money)
- Errors (manual data entry)
- No visibility (reactive, not proactive)
- No analytics (can't optimize what you can't measure)
- No audit trail (disputes are he-said-she-said)

The question isn't 'can we afford a TMS?' It's 'can
we afford the hidden costs of not having one?'

Let me show you what that's actually costing you..."
```

### vs. FarEye/Locus

```
"FarEye and Locus are good at what they do—primarily
last-mile delivery optimization.

If you're an e-commerce company focused on delivery
routing, they might be a fit.

Where we're different:
- Focus: Full TMS for manufacturing vs. last-mile focus
- Strength: Freight cost optimization vs. route optimization
- Industry: Steel, cement, FMCG manufacturing vs. e-commerce

The question is: is your primary challenge last-mile
delivery, or is it plant-to-customer visibility and
freight cost control?"
```
