## Stakeholder Talking Points

### For CFO

**Lead with**:
- Total cost of ownership (TCO) comparison
- Payback period and ROI
- Risk reduction (penalties, errors)
- CapEx vs. OpEx flexibility

**Key Messages**:
```
1. "This investment pays back in [X] months through freight
   cost reduction alone."

2. "We're currently losing approximately ₹[X] per month in
   detention and billing errors - this eliminates 70% of that."

3. "Transaction-based pricing means we pay for value, not
   shelf-ware. No large upfront commitment."

4. "The phased approach lets us prove value before full
   commitment."
```

**Data to Bring**:
- Current freight spend breakdown
- Detention cost trending
- Invoice error rate
- Manual reconciliation cost

### For VP Operations

**Lead with**:
- Visibility and control improvements
- Team efficiency gains
- OTIF improvement potential
- Day-in-the-life transformation

**Key Messages**:
```
1. "Your team is spending [X] hours per week on tracking calls.
   This eliminates 80% of that - time better spent on exceptions."

2. "Real-time visibility means you know about delays before
   customers call to complain."

3. "We can finally benchmark cost-per-lane and hold carriers
   accountable."

4. "The dispatch team will see immediate workload reduction -
   this is a gift, not more work."
```

**Data to Bring**:
- Current tracking workflow
- Exception handling time
- OTIF trending by lane
- Carrier performance issues

### For IT/CIO

**Lead with**:
- Integration approach (APIs, not custom)
- Security and compliance
- Implementation timeline and resources
- Ongoing maintenance requirements

**Key Messages**:
```
1. "Pre-built SAP connector means integration in weeks, not
   months. Your team's involvement is minimal."

2. "Cloud-native, SOC 2 compliant, data stays in India."

3. "We need 0.5 FTE for 2 months during implementation, then
   it's self-service for business users."

4. "No infrastructure to manage - this is true SaaS, we handle
   updates and maintenance."
```

**Data to Bring**:
- Current tech stack overview
- Integration requirements
- Security questionnaire
- Data residency requirements

## Objection Handling for Champions

### "We've tried this before and it didn't work"

**Response Framework**:
1. Acknowledge: "That's fair - not all implementations succeed."
2. Explore: "What went wrong last time?"
3. Differentiate: "Here's why this is different..."
4. Mitigate: "Here's how we prevent that..."

**Fretron Differentiators**:
- India-first design (not adapted from Western markets)
- Transaction pricing (no shelf-ware risk)
- Rapid pilot (prove value in 6 weeks)
- Business-led implementation (not IT project)

### "Now isn't the right time"

**Response Framework**:
1. Understand: "What's driving that concern?"
2. Quantify: "Every month costs us ₹[X] in [specific loss]"
3. Connect: "Actually, [upcoming event] makes now ideal because..."
4. Reduce: "What if we started with just a pilot?"

**Timing Triggers to Reference**:
- Freight contract renewal coming up
- Budget planning cycle
- New plant/expansion
- Customer SLA commitments
- Competitive pressure

### "It's too expensive"

**Response Framework**:
1. Reframe: "Let's look at cost vs. value..."
2. Compare: "Here's what we're spending now on [workarounds]"
3. De-risk: "Pay-per-transaction means we only pay for what we use"
4. Phase: "Start small, prove ROI, then expand"

**TCO Comparison Points**:
- Manual tracking labor cost
- Detention and demurrage
- Billing errors and disputes
- Penalty exposure
- Opportunity cost of poor visibility
