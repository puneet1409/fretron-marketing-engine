# Fluint & "Selling With" Frameworks

Extended framework details from Fluint's buyer enablement methodology and Nate Nasralla's book **"Selling With: The Art of Selling with Champions to Shape Internal Buying Conversations"** (2023).

> **Core Philosophy**: "Effective sales professionals don't sell TO buyers—they sell WITH them. Since reps rarely witness the moments that make or break deals, the job becomes enabling champions to shape internal conversations and drive decisions."
> — Nate Nasralla

## The Shift from Sales 1.0 to 2.0

| Sales 1.0 (Traditional) | Sales 2.0 (Buyer-Enabled) |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| Seller is the "author" | Seller is the "editor" |
| Focus on product features | Focus on buyer's business case |
| Sales meetings drive decisions | Internal buyer meetings drive decisions |
| Reactive to objections | Proactive champion enablement |
| Pitch-focused | Business case-focused |

## Champion Quality Tests (from "Selling With")

A champion serves as "the glue between three different sets of contacts": daily users, key stakeholders (security, legal, IT, procurement), and decision-makers. Without solid champions, deal alignment becomes nearly impossible.

### Four Tests for Champion Quality

| Test | What to Look For | Strong Signal | Weak Signal |
|------|------------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Channel Switching** | Will they use text/Slack/WhatsApp? | Gives personal number, responds off-hours | Email-only communication |
| **Process Articulation** | Can they explain the buying process? | Details steps, stakeholders, timeline | "I'm not sure how this gets approved" |
| **Action Follow-Through** | Do they complete value-adding tasks? | Does internal homework without prompting | Needs constant chasing |
| **Training Receptiveness** | Will they be coached on internal selling? | Asks for talking points, practices pitch | "Just send me the deck" |

### Champion as Internal Seller

> "More than 90% of B2B buying happens during internal meetings—not sales meetings—which means deals are won and lost when you're not in the room."

**Implications:**
- You must equip champions to sell when you're absent
- Written materials travel further than verbal conversations
- Champion's credibility determines idea reception
- Your words must work in rooms you'll never enter

## Key Fluint Frameworks

### SCR Framework (for problem statements)
- **S**ituation: What's the current state?
- **C**omplication: What's making it worse?
- **R**esolution: What needs to happen?

**Example for Fretron:**
```
SITUATION:
Managing 500+ daily shipments across 15 Excel sheets

COMPLICATION:
- Operations: 500+ daily tracking calls, no exception visibility
- Finance: 45-day freight reconciliation cycle, 3-5% billing errors
- Service: 82% OTIF vs. 95% customer expectation

RESOLUTION NEEDED:
Single source of truth for shipment visibility with automated reconciliation
```

### Future-State Press Release
Write aspirational "success story" from the future - what will have changed, who benefited, what metrics improved?

**Template:**
```
[12 months from now]

"[Company] achieved [specific metric improvement] in first year
of [initiative], exceeding original targets. Key outcomes included:
- [Outcome 1 with number]
- [Outcome 2 with number]
- [Outcome 3 with number]

[Quote from champion about success]"
```

### Selling in Vectors
Map each contact's influence direction in buying committee:

| Contact | Role | Vector Direction | Engagement Priority |
|---------|------|------------------|---------------------|
| VP Ops | Champion | Pushes deal forward | High - Maintain |
| CFO | Economic Buyer | Needs convincing | High - Convert |
| IT Head | Technical Evaluator | Neutral | Medium - Engage |
| Procurement | Gatekeeper | Can slow down | Low - Monitor |

**Vector Questions:**
- Who moves decisions forward?
- Who blocks or slows?
- Who influences whom?
- Where are gaps in coverage?

### Forward-Worthy Communication
Create content champions proudly forward internally:
- **Concise**: Scannable, not walls of text
- **Customer-language**: Uses their terminology, not vendor-speak
- **Internal ammunition**: Makes their argument stronger
- **Easy to share**: Can be forwarded without explanation
- **Positioning**: Makes champion look strategic

### Account Mapping (from "Selling With")

Create dynamic maps showing information flow: who must communicate what, to whom, when.

**Three-Bullet Contact Profiles:**
```
Contact: [Name], [Title]
1. Buying Role: [Champion/Economic Buyer/Evaluator/User]
2. Current Priority: [What keeps them up at night]
3. Key Metrics: [What they're measured on]
```

**Information Flow Questions:**
- Who must communicate what, to whom, when?
- What are existing communication channels (standing meetings, Slack, Teams)?
- Who influences whom in this organization?
- Where are silent or fading contacts (potential blockers)?

**Pro Tip:** Consult non-competitive peers and consultants who've sold into the account previously.

## Fluint Discovery Stages

1. **Problem Identified**: First contacts confirm/refine the point of view
2. **Problem Validated**: 3+ buyers edit the problem statement
3. **Executive Sponsorship**: An executive sponsors an internal project
4. **Approach Confirmed**: Committee decides to buy (with requirements aligning to you)
5. **Vendor Confirmed**: Selected as the vendor
6. **Timeline On-Track**: Implementation planning begins
7. **Paperwork Signed**: Contract executed

## The 72% Quality Standard

> "Presence > Perfection"

A business case at 72% quality ("C-" level) that EXISTS beats a perfect one that never gets created.

**Implications:**
- Don't over-polish before sharing with champion
- Iterate through co-creation
- Get it in front of buyers quickly
- Refine based on feedback

## Measuring Champion Effectiveness

### Leading Indicators
- % of deals with business case
- Business case quality score
- Stakeholder coverage per deal
- Champion engagement level
- Time to create business case

### Lagging Indicators
- Win rate improvement
- Sales cycle compression
- Average deal size
- Forecast accuracy
- Customer success/retention

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Pilot (Months 1-2)
- Train team on Sales Process 2.0 principles
- Select 3-5 pilot deals
- Create business case templates for Fretron
- Track early results and iterate

### Phase 2: Refine (Months 3-4)
- Analyze what's working in pilot deals
- Refine business case quality and templates
- Share best practices across team
- Expand beyond pilot deals

### Phase 3: Scale (Months 5-6)
- Roll out to full sales team
- Integrate into CRM and sales process
- Make business case mandatory for all opportunities
- Establish review cadence

### Phase 4: Optimize (Ongoing)
- Continuous improvement of templates
- Regular win/loss analysis
- Champion feedback incorporation
- Metrics tracking and refinement

## Best Practices: Do's and Don'ts

### Do's ✅
- Co-create business cases WITH champions, not FOR them
- Use customer's actual language and metrics
- Focus on presence over perfection (72% rule)
- Multi-thread across buying committee
- Help buyers make low-regret decisions
- Make business case a collaborative, living document
- Iterate based on champion feedback
- Track which sections resonate most

### Don'ts ❌
- Don't create business case without champion input
- Don't use theoretical metrics or vendor claims
- Don't wait for perfection before sharing
- Don't rely on single-threaded relationships
- Don't position it as a "sales document"
- Don't create and forget—iterate continuously
- Don't assume you know the problem better than the buyer
- Don't skip the validation stage (3+ buyers editing)

## Advanced "Selling With" Frameworks

### Discovery Roadmap

> "Good sales questions are measured by the level of curiosity they spark in your buyer"
> — Nate Nasralla

**Key Distinction:**
- **Qualification** = Account research with known answers (check-the-box)
- **Discovery** = Continuous, open-ended exploration of meaningful problems

**High-Impact Discovery Questions:**

| Question | What It Reveals |
|----------|-----------------|
| "What about this issue don't others seem to understand?" | Depth of champion's conviction, internal frustrations |
| "Which projects would you prioritize over this one?" | Real priority level, competing initiatives |
| "What must be true of a solution for it to work?" | Hidden requirements, past failures |
| "How would you create budget if this felt worthwhile?" | Budget process, workarounds, commitment level |
| "What metrics are you personally working toward?" | Individual motivation, alignment potential |

### Internal Narrative Creation

> "The best color scheme is camouflage."
> — Nate Nasralla

**Principles:**
- Use buyer branding, not yours
- Avoid battlecards (they trigger feature wars top sellers eschew)
- People value what they build more than what they buy
- Let champion co-author the narrative

**For Fretron:**
- Use customer's logo/colors on internal decks
- Quote their language back to them
- Let them edit/own the business case
- Position as "their initiative, supported by Fretron"

### Executive Meeting Strategy

**Preparation:**
- Prepare a "Most people believe X, but actually Y" statement
- Expect agenda drift (executives test you)
- Frame choices to clarify priority conflicts

**Example for Fretron:**
```
"Most logistics leaders believe the biggest freight savings
come from rate negotiations. But actually, operational
efficiency—reducing detention, optimizing loads, preventing
billing errors—often yields 3-5x more impact than rate cuts alone."
```

**Most Valuable Outcome:** Internal referrals bringing organizational priority

### Minimally Viable Committees

> "Build minimally viable committees: just enough people to confirm problems, create use cases, and clear contracts. Expanding committees signal dysfunction."

**The MVC Principle:**
- Just enough stakeholders to:
  - Confirm the problem is real
  - Create use cases
  - Clear contracts
- More people ≠ better decisions
- Expanding committee = deal in trouble

**Pricing in Groups:**
- Avoid group calls for pricing (people react differently in groups)
- Champion sacrifices social capital regardless of outcome
- One-on-one pricing discussions preferred

### Reverse Demo Approach

> "High performers ask buyers to demo their current workflows first."

**Process:**
1. Ask buyer to show you their current process
2. Identify 80/20 workflows (focus on what matters most)
3. Show how your solution handles those specific workflows
4. Focus on outcomes, not features
5. Offer screen control when appropriate

**For Fretron Discovery:**
```
"Before I show you Fretron, I'd love to understand your current
workflow. Could you walk me through how you track a shipment
from dispatch to delivery today? Where do you go, what do you
click, who do you call?"
```

### POC vs. Pilot Framework

| Element | POC (Proof of Concept) | Pilot |
|---------|------------------------|-------|
| **Purpose** | Validate hypothesis | Test with real audience |
| **Scope** | 80% reduced, narrow focus | Full functionality |
| **Audience** | Technical evaluators | Real end users |
| **Duration** | Days to weeks | Weeks to months |
| **Success** | "Yes, it works" | "Yes, we should buy" |

**Every POC Must Have:**
1. **Scope**: What are we testing (and NOT testing)?
2. **Timeline**: Start and end dates
3. **Hypothesis**: What success looks like
4. **Measurables**: Specific metrics to track
5. **Next Steps**: What happens if successful

**For Fretron POC:**
```
Scope: 5 lanes (Mumbai-Chennai, Mumbai-Bangalore, etc.)
Timeline: 4 weeks
Hypothesis: Can reduce tracking calls by 80%
Measurables: Tracking calls/day, OTIF visibility, user adoption
Next Steps: If successful, expand to all 50 lanes in Phase 2
```

### The Understand-Unpack-Respond Framework (Objection Handling)

**Three-Part Process:**

1. **Understand**: Confirm you heard correctly
   - "Let me make sure I understand..."
   - "So the concern is..."

2. **Unpack**: Explore the root of the objection
   - "Help me understand what's behind that..."
   - "What would need to be true for this not to be a concern?"

3. **Respond**: Address the actual concern (not the surface objection)

### Five Pricing Phrases

Memorize these for pricing conversations:

| # | Phrase | When to Use |
|---|--------|-------------|
| 1 | "You haven't asked, but I imagine you're curious about pricing" | Proactively raising pricing |
| 2 | "Our model is structured so that you..." | Explaining pricing structure |
| 3 | "How does that compare to expectations?" | After sharing price |
| 4 | "Some charge less; here's why we charge more" | Positioning premium price |
| 5 | "If free, would we still fit?" | Testing if price is real objection |

### Four Drivers of Deal Momentum

| Driver | Definition | Positive Signal | Negative Signal |
|--------|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Expanded Reach** | Early executive involvement | Multiple stakeholders engaged early | Single-threaded at low level |
| **Effective Follow-up** | Buyer activities (not seller hustle) | Champion completing action items | Only seller doing work |
| **Increased Commitment** | Growing consensus over time | Late-stage interactions gain value | Stakeholders dropping off |
| **Shorter Cycles** | Concentrated engagement | Intense activity in brief periods | Long gaps between touches |

### Trust as Pipeline Metric

> "Trust functions as a hidden pipeline measurement underlying visible velocity indicators."

**Trust Signals:**
- Champion shares internal information unprompted
- Buyers respond quickly to messages
- Introductions to other stakeholders happen easily
- Champion defends you in internal meetings
- Access to decision-makers granted

**Trust Erosion Signals:**
- Delayed responses
- Reduced information sharing
- Meetings cancelled/rescheduled
- Questions you've already answered
- Requests for "more references"

### The Writer Mindset

> "Think of yourself as a writer—your words travel and influence when you're absent."

**Implications:**
- Every email may be forwarded
- Your champion quotes you in internal meetings
- Written clarity beats verbal persuasion
- Documents live longer than conversations

**For Fretron:**
- Write business cases assuming CFO will see them
- Email summaries should be forward-worthy
- Every document is a sales tool
