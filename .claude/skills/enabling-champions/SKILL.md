# Enabling Champions

**Depends on**: `trust-building-principles`

## Core Insight

**Sales reps don't close deals—buyers do. 90% of B2B buying happens in internal meetings you're not in.**

Your job: Be the "editor" helping champions create their narrative, not the "author" pushing your pitch.

## Champion vs Coach

| Champion | Coach |
|----------|-------|
| Actively sells internally | Provides information |
| Has skin in the game | Wants to help you |
| Introduces you to others | Stays in background |
| Co-creates business case | Reviews your materials |
| Takes ownership | Advises and guides |

**You need a Champion.** A Coach is helpful but insufficient.

## Champion Tests

**Will they multi-thread?**
- "Would it help to include [stakeholder]?"
- Champion: "Yes, I'll set that up" ✓
- Not champion: "Let me think about it" ✗

**Will they share context?**
- "What's the internal process for this decision?"
- Champion: Shares details openly ✓
- Not champion: Vague or defensive ✗

**Will they co-create?**
- "Can we work on the business case together?"
- Champion: "Yes, here's what I need" ✓
- Not champion: "Just send me something" ✗

## The 1-Page Business Case

Enable your champion to sell internally. **Presence > Perfection.**

### Structure

1. **Priority-Driven Headline** - Connect to executive's existing initiative
2. **Sharp Problem Statement** - Cost and impact of current state (their language)
3. **Recommended Approach** - Capabilities needed, not features
4. **Target Outcomes** - Specific, measurable transformation
5. **Required Investment** - Budget, timeline, resources

### Co-Creation Loop

```
Discovery → Draft → Champion Review → Refine → Enable
```

Champion should correct, add context, validate language. It's THEIR document.

## Multi-Threading

Single-threaded deals are fragile. For each key account:

| Role | Focus |
|------|-------|
| Champion | Deep engagement, owns the deal |
| Economic buyer | ROI, risk, budget |
| Technical influencer | Integration, security |
| End users | Day-to-day pain |

Get champion to facilitate introductions: "Would it help to include [person]?"

## When Champions Stall

**Diagnose first:**
- Champion not actually a champion (just a coach)
- Champion lacks organizational power
- Business case not compelling enough
- Competing priorities / wrong timing

**Unstalling tactics:**
- More proof points for their internal argument
- Reference calls with peers
- Executive sponsor engagement
- Connect to deadline or event
- Quantify cost of delay

## Champion's Real Motivation

Champions bet their reputation on you. Make them the hero:
- Frame wins as THEIR achievement
- Provide materials they can present as their own
- Success with your product = their promotion

## Seniority Qualification

| Level | Reality | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| N-3 | Info gatherers | Ask for intro up |
| N-2 | May recommend | Useful, need higher |
| N-1 | Can champion | Good starting point |
| N | Signs check | Must engage eventually |

**Test**: Do you have their cell phone number? Real relationship marker.

## Integration
