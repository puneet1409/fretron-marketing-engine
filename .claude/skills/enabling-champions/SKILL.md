# Enabling Champions

**Depends on**: `trust-building-principles`

## Core Insight

**Sales reps don't close deals—buyers do. 90% of B2B buying happens in internal meetings you're not in.**

Your job: Be the "editor" helping champions create their narrative, not the "author" pushing your pitch.

**The IKEA Effect**: People value what they help create. Co-create the business case WITH your champion—don't hand them a finished deck.

## Champion vs Coach

| Champion | Coach |
|----------|-------|
| Actively sells internally | Provides information |
| Has skin in the game | Wants to help you |
| Introduces you to others | Stays in background |
| Co-creates business case | Reviews your materials |
| Takes ownership | Advises and guides |

**You need a Champion.** A Coach is helpful but insufficient.

## Champion Tests

**Behavioral validation** (actions > words):

| Test | Champion Signal | Not a Champion |
|------|-----------------|----------------|
| Multi-thread ask | "Yes, I'll set that up" | "Let me think about it" |
| Context sharing | Shares details openly | Vague or defensive |
| Co-creation invite | "Yes, here's what I need" | "Just send me something" |
| Follow-through | Completes assigned tasks | Excuses, delays |
| Internal advocacy | Presents to others proactively | Waits for you to push |

**Momentum signals**: Increasing time investment, shorter response cycles, champion driving pace forward.

## The 1-Page Business Case

Enable your champion to sell internally. **Presence > Perfection.**

### Structure

1. **Priority-Driven Headline** - Connect to executive's existing initiative
2. **Sharp Problem Statement** - Cost and impact of current state (their language)
3. **Recommended Approach** - Capabilities needed, not features
4. **Target Outcomes** - Specific, measurable transformation
5. **Required Investment** - Budget, timeline, resources

### The Build Loop (Co-Creation)

```
Draft → Share → Expand Circle → Iterate → Socialize → Enable
```

1. **Start with framework** - Few sentences in shared doc, not polished deck
2. **Share early** - Request feedback to unlock collaboration
3. **Expand the circle** - "Who do you turn to for advice on important projects?"
4. **Assign accountability** - Use tasks as champion validation tests
5. **Socialize internally** - Guide champion to present to stakeholders
6. **Iterate based on feedback** - Quality emerges through cycles

**It's THEIR document.** Champion should correct, add context, validate language.

### SCR Framework (Alternative Structure)

For executive presentations, use **Situation-Complication-Recommendation**:

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Situation** | Facts everyone agrees on (company priorities, current state) |
| **Complication** | Why this requires action NOW (consequences of inaction) |
| **Recommendation** | Specific approach, not just "buy our product" |

**Tip**: Flip to RCR (lead with recommendation) when buyer is already in active evaluation.

## Multi-Threading

Single-threaded deals are fragile. 6-10 decision-makers is typical for enterprise deals.

| Role | Focus | Why They Matter |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| Champion | Deep engagement | Owns the deal internally |
| Economic buyer | ROI, risk, budget | Signs the check |
| Technical influencer | Integration, security | Can veto |
| End users | Day-to-day pain | Use case validation |

**Multi-thread the RIGHT way**:
- Champion facilitates intros: "Would it help to include [person]?"
- Contain the group—laser focus on who moves the needle
- Verify problem matters to COMPANY, not just your contact
- Multiple roles agreeing problem is "big deal" = good sign

**Two conversations happening**: The one with you AND the one they're having internally. Frame materials in THEIR language or leave your message to chance.

## When Champions Stall

**Diagnose first:**
- Champion not actually a champion (just a coach)
- Champion lacks organizational power
- Business case not compelling enough
- Competing priorities / wrong timing

**Unstalling tactics:**
- More proof points for their internal argument
- Reference calls with peers
- Executive sponsor engagement
- Connect to deadline or event
- Quantify cost of delay

## Champion's Real Motivation

Champions bet their reputation on you. Make them the hero:
- Frame wins as THEIR achievement
- Provide materials they can present as their own
- Success with your product = their promotion

## Seniority Qualification

| Level | Reality | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| N-3 | Info gatherers | Ask for intro up |
| N-2 | May recommend | Useful, need higher |
| N-1 | Can champion | Good starting point |
| N | Signs check | Must engage eventually |

**Test**: Do you have their cell phone number? Real relationship marker.

## Deal Acceleration Playbook

When deals stall, use these tactics to re-ignite momentum:

### 1. Live Case Study Webinar
Invite pipeline accounts to see similar company succeed. Champion brings colleagues. Social proof + multi-threading in one event.

### 2. Pre-Meeting Education
Send short video or 1-pager BEFORE scheduled calls. Reduces meeting time on basics, focuses discussion on their specific situation.

### 3. Executive Roundtable
Small format (6-10 people). Bring your champion's exec alongside peer executives. Peer influence accelerates internal approval.

### 4. Multi-Thread via Events
Use events to naturally meet other stakeholders without champion feeling bypassed. "Would your [CFO/CTO/VP] find this valuable?"

### 5. Quantify Cost of Delay
Help champion articulate: "Every month we wait costs us $X." Create urgency with concrete numbers.

### Key Principle
**Don't just follow up—add value.** Each touchpoint should give them something useful, not just check on status.
