# Win/Loss Analysis Framework

Systematic approach to understanding why deals are won or lost and applying insights.

---

## Win/Loss Philosophy

### Why Win/Loss Matters

- **Win Rate**: Understanding wins helps replicate success
- **Loss Prevention**: Understanding losses helps avoid future ones
- **Competitive Intel**: Direct insight into how competitors sell
- **Product Feedback**: Real market feedback on capabilities
- **Sales Enablement**: What messaging and tactics work?
- **Marketing Insight**: Which leads convert? Why?

### Analysis Principles

1. **Interview, Don't Survey**: Rich insights come from conversation
2. **Third-Party When Possible**: Buyers are more honest with neutral parties
3. **Timely**: Conduct within 30 days of decision
4. **Systematic**: Every significant deal, not just convenient ones
5. **Actionable**: Insights must drive changes

## Deal Classification

### Win Types

| Type | Definition | Analysis Priority |
|------|------------|-------------------|
| Competitive Win | Chose Fretron over named competitor | High |
| Status Quo Win | Chose Fretron over doing nothing | Medium |
| Incumbent Displacement | Replaced existing solution | High |
| Greenfield Win | First TMS implementation | Medium |

### Loss Types

| Type | Definition | Analysis Priority |
|------|------------|-------------------|
| Competitive Loss | Lost to named competitor | High |
| No Decision | Prospect chose to do nothing | High |
| Incumbent Stay | Stayed with current solution | Medium |
| Budget Kill | Project cancelled/defunded | Low |
| Bad Fit | We disqualified or they did | Low |

### Analysis Thresholds

**Must Analyze**:
- All competitive wins/losses >₹5L ARR
- All deals involving strategic accounts
- All deals with new product/feature requests

**Should Analyze**:
- All competitive wins/losses
- All no-decision losses
- Deals with unusual sales cycles

**Optional**:
- Small deals with clear reasons
- Bad fit disqualifications

## Interview Process

### Interview Timing

| Outcome | Interview Window | Follow-Up |
|---------|------------------|-----------|
| Win | 2-4 weeks post-close | 90-day check-in |
| Loss | 1-3 weeks post-decision | None (don't pester) |
| No Decision | 2-4 weeks after go-dark | Quarterly check |

### Who Conducts Interviews?

**Internal Options**:
- Customer Success (for wins)
- Sales Leadership (selective)
- Product Marketing

**External Options (Preferred for Losses)**:
- Third-party research firm
- Consultant or advisor
- Industry analyst

### Interview Request Templates

**Win Interview Request**:
```
SUBJECT: Quick call about your Fretron decision?

Hi [Name],

Now that you've been live with Fretron for a few weeks, I'd love
to get your honest feedback on the buying process.

This isn't a sales call—I genuinely want to understand:
- What made you choose Fretron over other options?
- What almost made you NOT choose us?
- How can we improve for future buyers like you?

15 minutes would be incredibly helpful. Your insights will
directly shape how we work with companies like [Company].

Would [Day] at [Time] work?

[Name]
```

**Loss Interview Request (Third Party)**:
```
SUBJECT: Quick research call? (Not a sales pitch)

Hi [Name],

I'm [Name] with [Research Firm/neutral party]. We're conducting
research on TMS buying decisions for mid-market manufacturers.

Fretron mentioned you recently evaluated them. I'd love to hear
your honest perspective on the experience—this is completely
confidential research, not a sales follow-up.

The call would be 15-20 minutes. Your feedback helps shape
better products and buying experiences industry-wide.

Would you have time this week?

[Name]
```

**No-Decision Follow-Up**:
```
SUBJECT: Quick question on your logistics project

Hi [Name],

I noticed we lost touch on the logistics visibility project
you were exploring. No pitch here—just curious:

Did you end up solving it another way, or is it still on
the back burner?

If it's still a challenge, happy to reconnect. If you went
another direction, I'd love to learn from that.

[Name]
```

## Interview Guides

### Win Interview Questions (30 min)

**Opening (2 min)**:
```
"Thanks for taking the time. I want to understand your buying
journey so we can help future companies like yours. This is
completely about learning—not selling you anything else.

Mind if I ask some questions about your decision process?"
```

**The Journey (10 min)**:
```
TRIGGER:
"Take me back to the beginning. What triggered the search
for a TMS solution?"

"Was there a specific event or moment that made this a priority?"

EVALUATION:
"How did you first hear about Fretron?"

"Who else did you consider? How did you narrow it down?"

"What were your top 2-3 criteria when evaluating options?"
```

**The Decision (10 min)**:
```
DIFFERENTIATORS:
"What ultimately made you choose Fretron over [alternatives]?"

"Was there a specific moment or factor that tipped the decision?"

"What did we do well during the sales process?"

"Without naming names if you prefer, how did [competitor]
compare in your evaluation?"

```

**Closing (3 min)**:
```
"If you were advising a peer considering a TMS, what would
you tell them about the process?"

similar companies in the future?"
```

### Loss Interview Questions (20 min)

**Opening (2 min)**:
```
"Thanks for taking the time. I know you went a different
direction, and that's totally fine. I'm here to learn so
we can improve—this isn't about changing your mind.

Would you be comfortable sharing some honest feedback?"
```

**Understanding the Decision (10 min)**:
```
OUTCOME:
"Can you tell me what you ultimately decided to do?"

"What drove that decision?"

PROCESS:
"Looking back at your evaluation, what were your top criteria?"

"How did Fretron stack up on those criteria?"

THE GAP:
"Where did we fall short compared to [chosen solution]?"

"Was there anything we didn't understand about your needs?"

"Was there a specific moment where you felt Fretron wasn't
the right fit?"
```

**What Could Have Changed (5 min)**:
```
"Looking back, is there anything we could have done differently
that might have changed the outcome?"
