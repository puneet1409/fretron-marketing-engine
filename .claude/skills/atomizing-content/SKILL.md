# Atomizing Content

## Core Insight

**Create once, distribute many times. One substantial piece becomes 10-20 smaller pieces across platforms.**

Pillar content → Medium content → Micro content

## The Atomization Hierarchy

```
PILLAR (1,500-3,000 words)
├── Blog posts, guides, reports, case studies
│
MEDIUM (500-1,000 words)
├── Newsletter issues, LinkedIn articles, video scripts
│
MICRO (50-300 words)
└── Social posts, carousels, quote graphics, short videos
```

## What to Extract

From any pillar content, identify:
- Key insights (standalone posts)
- Statistics/data points (quote graphics)
- Step-by-step processes (carousels, threads)
- Quotes (graphics)
- Examples (case snippets)

## Transformation Patterns

### Blog → LinkedIn Post
Extract ONE insight, make it standalone:
```
[Hook - provocative statement]
[2-3 sentences context]
[Insight in bullets or short paragraphs]
[Takeaway or question]
```

### Blog → Carousel (8-12 slides)
1. Hook slide (problem/promise)
2. Context
3-8. Main points (one per slide)
9. Summary
10. CTA

### Blog → Thread
```
1/ Hook (must stand alone)
2/ Context
3-8/ Main points
9/ Summary
10/ CTA
```

### Case Study → Multiple Formats
| Format | Extract |
|--------|---------|
| LinkedIn post | Key result + one insight |
| Carousel | Problem → Solution → Result |
| Quote graphic | Customer quote + result |
| Email snippet | Teaser for nurture |
| Sales one-pager | Summary for sales |

## Platform Quick Reference

| Platform | Optimal Length | Key Format |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| LinkedIn | 150-200 words | Line breaks, bullets |
| Twitter/X | 280 chars/tweet | Threads for depth |
| Instagram | Visual-first | Carousels |
| YouTube | 8-15 min long-form | Chapters, timestamps |

## Distribution Cadence

```
Day 1:  LinkedIn post (main insight)
Day 3:  Carousel (framework)
Day 5:  Thread on X
Day 7:  Newsletter mention
Day 10: Short video
```
