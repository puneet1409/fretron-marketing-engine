# Content Atomization Playbook

Systematic approach to extracting maximum value from every piece of content.

## The Atomization Framework

### Core Principle

**One Hero → Many Atoms**

Every substantial piece of content (pillar page, webinar, case study) should spawn 10-20 derivative pieces across channels.

### Content Hierarchy

```
HERO CONTENT (1 piece)
│
├── PILLAR DERIVATIVES (3-5 pieces)
│   ├── Blog posts
│   ├── Landing pages
│   └── Long-form guides
│
├── SOCIAL ATOMS (10-15 pieces)
│   ├── LinkedIn posts
│   ├── Twitter threads
│   ├── Carousel slides
│   └── Quote graphics
│
├── NURTURE ATOMS (5-8 pieces)
│   ├── Email snippets
│   ├── Newsletter sections
│   └── Drip campaign content
│
└── SALES ATOMS (3-5 pieces)
    ├── One-pagers
    ├── Talk tracks
    └── Objection handlers
```

- Performance of original piece
- ICP relevance
- Gaps in current channel coverage

### Step 2: Extraction Planning

**Extraction Matrix**:

| Source Section | LinkedIn | Email | Sales | SEO |
|---------------|----------|-------|-------|-----|
| Intro/Hook | Post 1 | Snippet 1 | Talk track | - |

### Step 3: Batch Production

**Weekly Atomization Sprint**:
- Monday: Select hero content, create extraction plan
- Tuesday: Write all LinkedIn atoms
- Wednesday: Write all email atoms
- Thursday: Create sales atoms
- Friday: Schedule/publish, update tracking

### Step 4: Performance Tracking

**Track Per Atom**:
- Engagement (likes, comments, shares)
- Click-through to source
- Conversions from atom
- Time on page (if web content)

**Track Per Hero**:
- Total atoms created
- Total reach across atoms
- Pipeline influenced
