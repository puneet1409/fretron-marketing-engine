# Accelerating Time-to-Value

## Core Insight

**Nearly all winning growth tactics collapse time between discovery and first positive outcome.**

The faster prospects experience value, the faster they convert and expand.

## Value Milestone Map

```
DISCOVERY → UNDERSTANDING → DEMO → SAMPLE VALUE → PILOT → FULL VALUE
   Day 0       Day 1-3       Day 7    Day 14        Day 30     Day 90

Compress each transition.
```

## Quick Win Strategies by Stage

### Discovery → Understanding (Target: Same Day)

- Interactive product tour (5-10 min, self-guided)
- Value calculator (input their numbers, see potential)
- Industry-specific landing pages

### Understanding → Demo (Target: 3 Days)

- On-demand demo video
- Self-service demo environment
- Instant calendar scheduling

### Demo → Sample Value (Target: 7 Days)

- Value simulator with their data
- Mini-audit (analyze their current state)
- Zero-integration trial (manual data entry)

### Sample → Pilot (Target: 14 Days)

- Pre-built pilot package (fixed scope, fixed price)
- No-code data import (Excel/CSV)
- Champion enablement kit

### Pilot → Full Value (Target: 45 Days)

- Phased rollout plan
- Self-service training
- Pre-built integrations

## The Value Audit (Quick Win Wedge)

**Input** (from prospect):
- 1 month shipment data
- Current costs
- OTIF performance

**Output** (from you):
- Quantified inefficiencies
- Specific improvement opportunities
- Value projection

**Timeline**: 5 business days
**Result**: Proof before commitment

## Activation Metrics

| Stage | "Activated" When... |
|-------|---------------------|
| Demo | Asks follow-up, requests pilot info |
| Pilot | First successful transaction tracked |
| Customer | 80% target volume flowing through |
| Value | Measured improvement vs baseline |

## Common Pitfalls

1. Showing features, not outcomes
2. One-size-fits-all onboarding
3. Pilot scope creep (start small)
4. No success criteria defined upfront
5. Training delayed until after go-live

## Integration

- Lead magnets for value preview → `generating-lead-magnets`
- Champion enablement → `enabling-champions`
- Trust calibration → `trust-building-principles`
