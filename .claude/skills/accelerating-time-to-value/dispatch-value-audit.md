   - 20-500/day → Sweet spot
   - >500/day → Enterprise complexity

2. **Current State**: How do you track shipments today?
   - Excel/Manual → High opportunity
   - Partial system → Moderate opportunity
   - Full TMS → Lower opportunity (replacement play)

3. **Pain Clarity**: What's your biggest logistics challenge?
   - Specific answer → Ready for audit
   - Vague answer → Need more discovery

4. **Authority**: Can you share operational data with me?
   - Yes → Proceed
   - Need approval → Identify decision-maker
```

### Objection Handling

**"These numbers seem high"**
```
"Let me show you the math. [Walk through specific calculation].
This is based on YOUR data, not industry averages. Of course,
actual results depend on implementation, but this is what the
data suggests is possible."
```

**"We've tried to fix this before"**
```
"What happened? [Listen]. That's useful context. The difference
with this approach is [specific differentiator]. But you're
right to be cautious—which is why I'd suggest a focused pilot
to prove it out before any major commitment."
```

**"I need to share this internally"**
```
"Of course. Would it help if I joined a brief call with your
team to walk through the methodology? Sometimes the numbers
need context. Either way, I'll send the full report for you
to share."
```
