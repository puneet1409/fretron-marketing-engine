# Thought Leadership POV Development - Session Context
**Date:** 2026-01-26
**Owner:** Puneet → Vikas (handoff)
**Status:** In Progress - Brainstorming Phase

---

## Session Goal

Develop 20-30 pillar LinkedIn thought leadership posts based on Fretron's POV for supply chain executives. Posts will be tested for resonance, iterated, and refined over coming weeks.

---

## Key Inputs Identified

### 1. Core POV Documents (from fretron-fundraise-deck)
- **Location:** `/home/puneet/dev/fretron-fundraise-deck/01-strategy/puneet-pov-golden-content.md`
- **Key Beliefs:**
  1. **Gateway Thesis** - TMS as gateway to AI transformation (like RevOps for CRM)
  2. **Decisions at Every Horizon** - Strategic → Mid-term → Tactical → Operational
  3. **Maturity Curve** - Prerequisites for value levers, transformation studio concept
  4. **Ecosystem Collaboration** - True value unlock beyond four walls

### 2. AI Software Thesis
- **Location:** `/home/puneet/dev/fretron-fundraise-deck/references/puneet-ai-software-thesis.md`
- **Key Point:** TMS/WMS commoditization vs. S&OP expansion
- Deterministic execution software loses value, judgment-intensive coordination gains value

### 3. Proprietary Data Assets (for data-driven posts)
- **87 Value Levers** with KPI impact data (`/home/puneet/dev/fretron-marketing-engine/data/levers.json`)
- **93 Blog Posts** with insights
- **Industry Coverage:** Steel, CPG, 3PL, Chemicals, Cement

---

## Design Decisions Made

### Format
**Short provocative posts (100-200 words)** - Hot takes that spark debate

### Audience
**Supply chain executives** (VP/Head of Supply Chain) - Building demand, educating buyers

### Tone/Style
**Educator + Data-driven storyteller**
- "Here's what I've learned after 8 years..."
- "We analyzed 10,000 shipments and found..."
- Builds trust, backed by proprietary data

## Thematic Buckets (Proposed)

### A. Transformation & Maturity
- Why transformations fail (skipping prerequisites)
- The maturity curve concept
- Bite-sized vs. big-bang approaches

### B. AI & Decision-Making
- AI as talent democratizer
- Decisions at different horizons (strategic to operational)
- Context graphs & decision traces

### C. Ecosystem & Collaboration
- Partner enablement
- Network effects in logistics
- Value beyond your four walls

### D. Cost & Operations
- Hidden costs in logistics
- Data from 10,000+ shipments
- ROI patterns across industries

### E. Industry-Specific Insights
- Steel vs. Cement vs. CPG logistics differences
- Vertical deep-dives with data

### F. Contrarian Takes
- TMS/WMS commoditization thesis
- Why S&OP expands while TMS shrinks
- The orchestration layer opportunity

## Next Steps for Vikas

### Immediate (This Session)
1. **Decide theme weighting** - Should all themes be covered evenly (3-5 posts each), or weight certain themes?
2. **Generate long-list** - Brainstorm 40-50 post ideas across themes
3. **Prioritize to 20-30** - Select highest-impact posts
4. **Create post templates** - Draft structure for each pillar post

### Follow-up
- Test posts for resonance
- Iterate based on engagement data
- Refine over coming weeks

---

## Key Questions Still Open

1. **Theme distribution:** Equal weight across 6 themes, or prioritize certain themes?
2. **Post structure:** Should we create a template/framework for consistency?
3. **Data integration:** Which proprietary data points to highlight in posts?
4. **Cadence:** How often should pillar posts be published? (Once/week? 2x/week?)
